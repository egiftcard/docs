The `ThirdwebManager` is a MonoBehaviour that provides a convenient and customizable way to instantiate and manage the [ThirdwebSDK](/unity/thirdwebsdk). Add the prefab to your scene and the SDK will persist throughout your game's lifecycle. It can be found at `Thirdweb/Core/Prefabs/ThirdwebManager`.

## Configuration

Configure `ThirdwebManager` through the Unity Inspector window. Here are the sections and their respective settings:

### General Settings

This section involves the basic blockchain configurations. Adjust the following settings:

- `Supported Chains`: A list of all blockchains your game /api-keyssupports. For each chain, provide an identifier, a chain ID, and optionally, an RPC override.
- `Client ID`: Thirdweb [API Key](https://thirdweb.com/api-key). Used for default thirdweb services such as Storage and Account Abstraction.
- `Initialize On Awake`: Whether the SDK should initialize on awake or not. If not, you can call `ThirdwebManager.Instance.Initialize("chain-identifier")` to initialize it manually.
- `Show Debug Logs`: Whether to show thirdweb sdk debug logs.

### App Metadata

This section lets you define how your app appears in wallet providers like Metamask, WalletConnect, and MagicLink. Modify the following fields:

### Smart Wallet Options

These settings are required to set up a smart wallet. Adjust the following:

### Native Prefabs (Danger Zone)

## Accessing the SDK

Once `ThirdwebManager` is set up and the game starts, it will instantiate the Thirdweb SDK based on your settings. You can access the instantiated SDK from other scripts using:

```csharp
var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;
```
