The `ThirdwebManager` is a MonoBehaviour that provides a convenient and customizable way to instantiate and manage the [ThirdwebSDK](/unity/thirdwebsdk). By attaching this script to a GameObject in your initial scene and using `DontDestroyOnLoad()`, the SDK remains instantiated throughout your game's lifecycle.

### Native Prefabs (Danger Zone)

## Accessing the SDK

Once `ThirdwebManager` is set up and the game starts, it will instantiate the Thirdweb SDK based on your settings. You can access the instantiated SDK from other scripts using:

```csharp
var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;
```
