The `ThirdwebManager` prefab is an empty game object containing a `ThirdwebManager` script, which
instantiates the [ThirdwebSDK](/unity/thirdwebsdk) for you to access anywhere in your game.

Using this prefab allows you to instantiate the SDK once, and use this instance anywhere in your
other scripts, rather than having to instantiate the SDK in each script.

The prefab is located at: `Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Prefabs/ThirdwebManager.prefab`.

## Configuration

From the `Inspector`, you can customize the following settings:

- `Chain`: The blockchain you want to instantiate the SDK on at this point in time.
- `Chain Data`: An array of the chains you want to support in your game.
- `Storage IPFS Gateway Url`: Override this value to use a custom IPFS gateway for the SDK.
