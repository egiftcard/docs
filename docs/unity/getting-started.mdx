Before getting started, you'll need to
[download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor).

Import the thirdweb SDK, by downloading the `.unitypackage` file for the version of the SDK
you want to use (_usually you&rsquo;ll want the latest version_) from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases) on the GitHub repository:

![Download Unity Package](./assets/unitypackage.png)

Add the package to your Unity project by clicking `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package` like so:

![Import Custom Package.png](./assets/import2.png)

Select the `.unitypackage` file you just downloaded from GitHub to open the `Import Unity Package` menu.

Leave the default files selected, and click `Import`:

![Click Import Button](./assets/import3.png)

In your `Project` window now, you'll be able to see all of the resources that were imported:

Now you&rsquo;re ready to use the SDK. Use any of the prefabs, scenes, or scripts that come within the `Examples` folder,
or create your own script and instantiate the SDK to get started.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// Import the Thirdweb SDK namespace
using Thirdweb;

public class ThirdwebSDKDemos : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Create a Thirdweb SDK instance for to use throughout this class
    private ThirdwebSDK sdk;

    void Start()
    {
        // When the app starts, set up the Thirdweb SDK
        // Here, we're setting up a read-only instance on the "goerli" test network.
        sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("goerli");
    }
}
```
