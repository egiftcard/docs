Before getting started, you'll need to
[download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor).

:::info
You will require an API key to use thirdweb’s infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
:::

Import the thirdweb SDK, by downloading the `.unitypackage` file for the version of the SDK
you want to use (_usually you’ll want the latest version_) from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases) on the GitHub repository:

![Download Unity Package](./assets/unitypackage.png)

Add the package to your Unity project by clicking `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package` like so:

Select the `.unitypackage` file you just downloaded from GitHub to open the `Import Unity Package` menu.

Leave the default files selected, and click `Import`:

In your `Project` window now, you'll be able to see all of the resources that were imported:

Now you’re ready to use the SDK. In your `Project` window, navigate to `Thirdweb` > `Core` > `Prefabs` > `ThirdwebManager` drag it into your scene. This [ThirdwebManager](./ThirdwebManager) acts as a singleton manager class for your Thirdweb SDK, providing a convenient interface for setting up and controlling SDK parameters directly from the Unity inspector.

All the configurable parameters are annotated with tooltips, just hover over them in the inspector to understand their purpose. After you have set up your [ThirdwebManager](./ThirdwebManager) according to your needs, you can access the SDK from any script using `ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK`.
