If the user _is_ eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```ts
ClaimEligibility[]

// ClaimEligibility Enum

}
```

</div>
</details>

## getClaimTransaction

This is useful for estimating the gas cost of a claim transaction,
overriding transaction options and having fine grained control over the transaction execution.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

The wallet address to claim tokens for.

Must be a `string`.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

</details>

## set - Claim Conditions

Overwrite the claim conditions for the drop.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open,
unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### price

The price per token in the currency specified above.

The default value is `0`.

#### maxClaimablePerWallet

The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim.

The default value is `unlimited`.

#### maxClaimableSupply

The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase.

For example, if you lazy mint 1000 tokens and set the `maxClaimableSupply` to 100,
then only 100 tokens will be claimable in this phase, leaving 900 tokens to be claimed in the next phases (if you have any).

This is useful for "early bird" use cases, where you allow users to claim a limited number of tokens at a discounted price during
the first X amount of time.

#### startTime

When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens).

The default value is immediately.

#### waitInSeconds

The amount of time between claims a wallet must wait before they can claim again.

The default value is `0`, meaning users can claim again immediately after claiming.

#### snapshot

A list of wallets that you want to override the default claim conditions for.

Wallet addresses within this list can be set to pay in a
different currency, have a different price, and have a different maximum claimable amount.

```ts
{
  address: string;
  currencyAddress?: string;
  maxClaimable?: number;
  price?: number;
}
```

#### merkleRootHash

If you want to provide your own merkle tree for your snapshot, provide the merkle root hash here.

This is only recommended for advanced use cases.

#### resetClaimEligibilityForAll

This means you reset any previous claim conditions that existed and
allow users to claim again as if the drop had just started.

A boolean value that determines whether to reset the claim conditions or to keep the existing state.

By resetting them, any previous claims that were made will be ignored by the claim condition restrictions.

For example, if you had a limit of 1 token per wallet, and a user claimed a token,
then you reset the claim conditions, that user will be able to claim another token.

Must be a `boolean`.

Defaults to `false`.

</div>
</details>

## update - Claim Conditions

Update a single claim phase, by providing the index of the claim
phase and the new phase configuration.

The `index` is the position of the phase in the list of phases you have made, starting from zero.
e.g. if you have two phases, the first phase has an index of `0` and the second phase has an index of `1`.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open, unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

```csharp

```

## generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of NFTs.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the
contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

The `mintRequest` object you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `to`, and `metadata` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### to (required)

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

```csharp

```

#### metadata (required)

The metadata of the NFT to mint.

Can either be a `string` URL that points to valid metadata that conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
or an object that conforms to the same standards.

If you provide an object, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

```csharp

```

#### currencyAddress (optional)

The address of the currency to pay for minting the tokens (use the [`price`](#price-optional) field to specify the price).

Defaults to `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (the native currency of the network, e.g. Ether on Ethereum).

```csharp

```

#### price (optional)

If you want the user to pay for minting the tokens, you can specify the price **per token**.

Defaults to `0` (free minting).

```javascript
const signature = await contract.erc721.signature.generate({
  quantity: "{{quantity}}",
  to: "{{wallet_address}}",
  metadata: {
    // ... Your NFT metadata
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  price: "{{price}}", // The user will have to pay `price * quantity` for minting the tokens
});
```

#### mintStartTime (optional)

The time from which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `Date.now()` (now).

```csharp

```

#### mintEndTime (optional)

The time until which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10),` (10 years from now).

```csharp

```

#### primarySaleRecipient (optional)

If a `price` is specified, the funds will be sent to the `primarySaleRecipient` address.

Defaults to the `primarySaleRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyBps (optional)

The percentage fee you want to charge for secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyBps` of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyRecipient (optional)

The address that will receive the royalty fees from secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### quantity (optional)

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

```csharp

```

</div>
</details>

## generateBatch

Generate a batch of signatures at once.

This is the same as [`generate`](#generate) but it allows you to generate multiple signatures at once.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### payloadsToSign

An array of objects containing the configuration options for each signature.

See [`generate`](#generate) for the configuration options available for each signature.

</div>
</details>

## mint - Signature-based

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature (required)

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

Must be of type `SignedPayload1155`.

```javascript
// Use the signed payload to mint the tokens
const txResult = contract.erc721.signature.mint(
  // highlight-next-line
  signature, // Signature generated by the `generate` function
);
```

</div>
</details>

## mintBatch - Signature-based

Use multiple signatures at once to mint tokens.

This is the same as [`mint`](#mint) but it allows you to provide multiple signatures at once.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signatures (required)

An array of signatures created by the [`generate`](#generate) or [`generateBatch`](#generatebatch) functions.

Must be of type `SignedPayload1155[]`.

</div>
</details>

## verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload, and prove that it was valid and was generated
by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint`/`mintBatch` functions will fail,
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp

```
