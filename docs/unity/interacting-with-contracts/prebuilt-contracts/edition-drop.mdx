```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

## set- Claim Conditions

Overwrite the claim conditions for a specific token ID.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open, unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### tokenId

The token ID of the NFT you want to set the claim conditions for.

#### price

The price per token in the currency specified above.

The default value is `0`.

#### maxClaimablePerWallet

The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim.

The default value is `unlimited`.

#### maxClaimableSupply

The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase.

For example, if you lazy mint 1000 tokens and set the `maxClaimableSupply` to 100,
then only 100 tokens will be claimable in this phase, leaving 900 tokens to be claimed in the next phases (if you have any).

This is useful for "early bird" use cases, where you allow users to claim a limited number of tokens at a discounted price during
the first X amount of time.

#### startTime

When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens).

The default value is immediately.

#### waitInSeconds

The amount of time between claims a wallet must wait before they can claim again.

The default value is `0`, meaning users can claim again immediately after claiming.

#### snapshot

A list of wallets that you want to override the default claim conditions for.

Wallet addresses within this list can be set to pay in a
different currency, have a different price, and have a different maximum claimable amount.

```ts
{
  address: string;
  currencyAddress?: string;
  maxClaimable?: number;
  price?: number;
}
```

#### merkleRootHash

If you want to provide your own merkle tree for your snapshot, provide the merkle root hash here.

This is only recommended for advanced use cases.

#### resetClaimEligibilityForAll

This means you reset any previous claim conditions that existed and
allow users to claim again as if the drop had just started.

A boolean value that determines whether to reset the claim conditions or to keep the existing state.

By resetting them, any previous claims that were made will be ignored by the claim condition restrictions.

For example, if you had a limit of 1 token per wallet, and a user claimed a token,
then you reset the claim conditions, that user will be able to claim another token.

Must be a `boolean`.

Defaults to `false`.

</div>
</details>

## setBatch - Claim Conditions

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

Provide an array of objects, each containing the `tokenId` and `claimConditions` you want to set.

</div>
</details>

## update - Claim Conditions

Update a single claim phase on a specific token ID, by providing the index of the claim
phase and the new phase configuration.

The `index` is the position of the phase in the list of phases you have made, starting from zero.
e.g. if you have two phases, the first phase has an index of `0` and the second phase has an index of `1`.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open, unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.
