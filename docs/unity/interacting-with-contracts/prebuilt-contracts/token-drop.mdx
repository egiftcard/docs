When using the [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20) smart contract,
there is **no need** to provide a contract type argument, as the functionality of the smart contract is all available
through the [extensions](/typescript/extensions) interface.

The extensions that the Token Drop contract supports are listed below.

- [ERC20](/typescript/sdk.erc20)
- [ERC20Burnable](/typescript/sdk.erc20burnable)
- [ERC20ClaimPhases](/typescript/sdk.erc20claimconditions)
- [ERC20Permit](/typescript/sdk.erc20permit)
- [PlatformFee](/typescript/sdk.platformfee)

If the user _is_ eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```ts
ClaimEligibility[]

// ClaimEligibility Enum
export enum ClaimEligibility {

  AddressNotAllowed = "This address is not on the allowlist.",
  WaitBeforeNextClaimTransaction = "Not enough time since last claim transaction. Please wait.",
  AlreadyClaimed = "You have already claimed the token.",
  NotEnoughTokens = "There are not enough tokens in the wallet to pay for the claim.",

  NoWallet = "No wallet connected.",
  Unknown = "No claim conditions found.",
}
```

</div>
</details>

## getClaimTransaction

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

The wallet address to get the merkle proofs for.

Must be a `string`.

## set - Claim Conditions

Overwrite the claim phases on the drop contract.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### price

The price per token in the currency specified above.

The default value is `0`.

#### maxClaimablePerWallet

The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim.

The default value is `unlimited`.

#### maxClaimableSupply

The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase.

For example, if you lazy mint 1000 tokens and set the `maxClaimableSupply` to 100,
then only 100 tokens will be claimable in this phase, leaving 900 tokens to be claimed in the next phases (if you have any).

This is useful for "early bird" use cases, where you allow users to claim a limited number of tokens at a discounted price during
the first X amount of time.

#### startTime

When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens).

The default value is immediately.

#### waitInSeconds

The amount of time between claims a wallet must wait before they can claim again.

The default value is `0`, meaning users can claim again immediately after claiming.

#### snapshot

A list of wallets that you want to override the default claim conditions for.

Wallet addresses within this list can be set to pay in a
different currency, have a different price, and have a different maximum claimable amount.

```ts
{
  address: string;
  currencyAddress?: string;
  maxClaimable?: number;
  price?: number;
}
```

</div>

## update - Claim Conditions

Update a single claim phase on the drop contract, by providing the index of that
