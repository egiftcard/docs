When using the [Pack](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Pack) smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

:::info Pack VRF

When using the [Chainlink VRF variation](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/PackVRF) of the Pack contract,
use the functionality of the [PackVRF Extension](/typescript/sdk.packvrf) instead.

:::

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `pack` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```csharp

```

In addition to the methods listed below, the pack contract supports the following extensions:

- [ERC1155](/typescript/sdk.erc1155)
- [ERC1155enumerable](/typescript/sdk.erc1155enumerable)
- [Royalty](/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty)
- [Permissions](/typescript/sdk.permissions)
- [ContractMetadata](/typescript/sdk.contractmetadata)
- [Ownable](/typescript/sdk.ownable)
- [Gasless](/typescript/sdk.gasless)

## addPackContents

Add additional tokens to the pool of tokens that can be opened from a pack.

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### packId

The ID of the pack you want to add tokens to.

For example, in your pack contract you may have a common pack with ID `0` and a rare pack with ID `1`.

To add more tokens to the common pack, you would pass `0` as the `packId`.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

#### rewards

An object containing three (optional) properties:

- `erc721Rewards`: An array of ERC721 tokens to add to the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress` and `tokenId` property.
- `erc1155Rewards`: An array of ERC1155 tokens to add to the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress`, `tokenId`, and `quantityPerReward` property.
- `erc20Rewards`: An array of ERC20 tokens to add to the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress` and `quantityPerReward` property.

</div>
</details>

## create

Mint a new pack NFT, which can be opened to receive rewards, to the **connected** wallet.

Each pack NFT is an ERC1155 token, which means it can have more than one quantity.

Provide the metadata for the pack NFT itself, and the rewards that can be opened from the pack.

The quantity of packs created is determined by the total number of rewards available, divided by the number of rewards per pack.
For example, if you had `20` total ERC20 rewards + `60` total ERC1155 rewards + `20` total ERC721 rewards,
and you wanted to create packs with `5` rewards each, the result would be the creation of `20` packs (100 total rewards / 5 rewards per pack = 20 packs).

```csharp

```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### packMetadata

Either a string containing a URL that points to, or an object that contains [standard metadata properties](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).

If you provide an object, (like the example above), the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS for you before the packs are minted. The IPFS URI is then used as the metadata for the pack NFT.

#### erc20Rewards

An array of ERC20 tokens to include in the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress`, `quantityPerReward`, and `totalRewards` property.

#### erc721Rewards

An array of ERC721 tokens to include in the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress` and `tokenId` property.

#### erc1155Rewards

An array of ERC1155 tokens to include in the pack. Each item in the array must be an object containing a `contractAddress`, `tokenId`, `quantityPerReward`, and `totalRewards` property.

#### openStartTime

The date that packs can start to be opened. Defaults to `new Date()` (i.e. now).

Must be of type `Date`.

#### rewardsPerPack

The number of rewards in each pack. Defaults to `1`.

Must be a `number`.
