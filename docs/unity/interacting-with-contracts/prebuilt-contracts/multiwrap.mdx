When using the [Multiwrap](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Multiwrap) smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `multiwrap` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```csharp

```

As each multiwrap NFT is a newly created NFT, in addition to functionalities listed, the multiwrap contract also implements the following extensions for you to use:

- [ERC721](/typescript/sdk.erc721)
- [ERC721Supply](/typescript/sdk.erc721supply)
- [ERC721Enumerable](/typescript/sdk.erc721enumerable)
- [Royalty](/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty)
- [Permissions](/typescript/sdk.permissions)
- [ContractMetadata](/typescript/sdk.contractmetadata)
- [Ownable](/typescript/sdk.ownable)
- [Gasless](/typescript/sdk.gasless)
