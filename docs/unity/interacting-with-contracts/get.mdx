title: Connect to a Contract
slug: /contract
---

Connect to a deployed smart contract to start interacting with it.

## Usage

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

## Configuration

### address (required)

The address of the smart contract you want to connect to.

Must be a `string`.

:::info Import Smart Contracts
If your smart contract was not deployed using thirdweb, you&rsquo;ll need to import it on the [dashboard](/dashboard).
:::

### Using Contract ABI

Optionally, (if you don&rsquo;t want to use the import feature),
you can provide your smart contract&rsquo;s ABI to the second parameter of the `getContract` method.
Useful when developing on a local node,
where it may be faster to use the ABI than to import the contract using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

The ABI is only necessary if you have not deployed your contract with, or imported your contract
to the thirdweb dashboard.

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("0x...", "my-abi");
```
