# ContractMetadata

Functionality available for contracts that inherit the [`ContractMetadata`](/contracts/ContractMetadata) contract.

Read, set, or update the metadata of a smart contract, such as it&rsquo;s name, description, image, etc.

If [`Permissions`](/typescript/sdk.permissions) are enabled, `admin` permissions are required to set/update the metadata (unless otherwise specified).

Under the hood, the metadata object you provide is uploaded and pinned to IPFS. The IPFS hash that is returned is then stored on-chain.
When you retrieve the metadata of a contract, the IPFS hash is retrieved from the blockchain and the metadata is retrieved from IPFS
and returned to you in an object.

## get

### Return Value

While the actual return type is `any`, you can expect an object containing
properties that follow the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata), outlined below:

```csharp

#### metadata

Provide an object containing the metadata of your smart contract following the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).

New properties will be added, and existing properties will be overwritten.
If you do not provide a new value for a previously set property, it will remain unchanged.

Below are the properties you can define on your smart contract.

```csharp

```

</div>
</details>

## set

**Overwrite** the metadata of a contract, an object following the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).

This operation ignores any existing metadata and replaces it with the new metadata provided.
