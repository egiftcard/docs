# ERC20SignatureMintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC20`](/contracts/IERC20) and
[`ISignatureMintERC20`](/contracts/ISignatureMintERC20) interfaces.

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/sdk/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) of new tokens.

## generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of tokens.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

The `mintRequest` object you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `quantity` and `to` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

```csharp

```

#### to (required)

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

```csharp

```

#### currencyAddress (optional)

The address of the currency to pay for minting the tokens (use the [`price`](#price-optional) field to specify the price).

Defaults to `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (the native currency of the network, e.g. Ether on Ethereum).

```csharp

```

#### price (optional)

If you want the user to pay for minting the tokens, you can specify the price **per token**.

Defaults to `0` (free minting).

```javascript
const signature = await contract.erc20.signature.generate({
  quantity: "{{quantity}}",
  to: "{{wallet_address}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  price: "{{price}}", // The user will have to pay `price * quantity` for minting the tokens
});
```

#### mintStartTime (optional)

The time from which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `Date.now()` (now).

```csharp

```

#### mintEndTime (optional)

The time until which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10),` (10 years from now).

```csharp

```

#### primarySaleRecipient (optional)

If a `price` is specified, the funds will be sent to the `primarySaleRecipient` address.

Defaults to the `primarySaleRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

## generateBatch

Generate multiple signatures at once (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signatures

An array of signatures to generate. See [`generate`](#generate) for details.

</div>
</details>

## mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature (required)

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

Must be of type `SignedPayload20`

```javascript
// Use the signed payload to mint the tokens
const txResult = contract.erc20.signature.mint(
  // highlight-next-line
  signature, // Signature generated by the `generate` function
);
```

</div>
</details>

## mintBatch

Use multiple signatures at once to mint tokens.

Each signature must be of type `SignedPayload20`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc20.signature.mintBatch([
  signature1, // Signature generated by the `generate` or `generateBatch` function
  signature2,
  signature3,
]);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signatures

An array of signatures to mint. Each signature must be of type `SignedPayload20`.

See [`mint`](#mint) for details.

</div>
</details>

## verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload,
and prove that it was valid and was generated by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint`/`mintBatch` functions will fail (even without this verification check),
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature

The signature to verify.

Must be of type `SignedPayload20`

See [`generate`](#generate) for details.
