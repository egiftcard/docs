Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC721`](/contracts/IERC721) and
[`ISignatureMintERC721`](/contracts/ISignatureMintERC721) interfaces.

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/sdk/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) of NFTs.

## Generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of NFTs.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the
contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};
var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC721MintPayload(receiverAddress, meta);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC721.signature.Generate(payload);
```

  <div>

The `mintRequest` object you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `to`, and `metadata` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### receiverAddress (required)

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

Must be a `string`.

#### metadata (required)

The metadata of the NFT to mint.

Must be a `string` URL that points to valid metadata that conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

#### currencyAddress (optional)

The address of the currency to pay for minting the tokens (use the [`price`](#price-optional) field to specify the price).

#### price (optional)

If you want the user to pay for minting the tokens, you can specify the price **per token**.

Defaults to `0` (free minting).

#### mintStartTime (optional)

The time from which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to now

#### mintEndTime (optional)

The time until which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10),` (10 years from now).

```csharp

```

#### primarySaleRecipient (optional)

If a `price` is specified, the funds will be sent to the `primarySaleRecipient` address.

Defaults to the `primarySaleRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyBps (optional)

The percentage fee you want to charge for secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyBps` of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyRecipient (optional)

The address that will receive the royalty fees from secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### quantity (optional)

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

```csharp

```

## Mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};
var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC721MintPayload(receiverAddress, meta);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC721.signature.Generate(payload);

// highlight-next-line
var data = await contract.ERC721.signature.Mint(signedPayload);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature (required)

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

</div>
</details>

## Verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload, and prove that it was valid and was generated
by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint` function will fail,
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### payload (required)

The payload to verify.

### Return Value

Returns `true` if the payload is valid, `false` otherwise.

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};
var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC721MintPayload(receiverAddress, meta);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC721.signature.Generate(payload);

// highlight-next-line
var data = await contract.ERC721.signature.Verify(signedPayload);
```
