# ERC1155Revealable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`ILazyMint`](/contracts/ILazyMint) interfaces and inherit the
[`DelayedReveal`](/contracts/DelayedReveal) contract.

Allows you to lazy-mint batches of NFTs that are encrypted until a later time,
and reveal them at any time using a password.

## createDelayedRevealBatch

Create a batch of encrypted NFTs that can be revealed at a later time.

Provide an array of metadata for the NFTs you want to create, which can either be a
`string` URL that points to metadata, or an object.
The metadata must conform to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

If you provide an object, it is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before being
lazy-minted into the contract.
