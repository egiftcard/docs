Functionality available for contracts that implement
the [`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) interface and [`LazyMint`](/contracts/LazyMint) contract.

## lazyMint

Lazy mint a new batch of NFTs into the smart contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata instead of objects.

The metadata must conform to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

```csharp
