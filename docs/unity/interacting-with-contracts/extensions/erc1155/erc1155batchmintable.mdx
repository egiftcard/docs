# ERC1155BatchMintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155Enumerable`](/contracts/IERC1155Enumerable),
[`IMintableERC1155`](/contracts/IMintableERC1155), and
[`IMulticall`](/contracts/IMulticall)
interfaces.

Allows you to mint multiple NFTs at once to a wallet address.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a string as the `metadata` property
that points to valid metadata object.

## mintBatch

Mint many different NFTs with limited supplies to the **connected wallet**.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### metadataWithSupply

An array of objects that contain the metadata and supply of each NFT you want to mint.

The `supply` property is the number of this NFT you want to mint.
Must be a `string`, `number`, `bigint`, or `BigNumber`.

The `metadata` object must follow the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).
Alternatively, you can provide a `string`s that points to a valid metadata object
to override the default behavior of uploading and pinning the metadata to IPFS (shown below).

```csharp

```
