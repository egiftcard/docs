# ERC1155Mintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`IMintableERC1155`](/contracts/IMintableERC1155) interfaces.

Allows you to mint new NFTs on the contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata object instead of an object.

## mint

Mint a new NFT to the **connected wallet**.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### metadataWithSupply

An object containing a `metadata` object and a `supply` property.

The metadata object can either be a string that points to valid metadata that
conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
or an object that conforms to the same standards.

If you provide an object, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

```csharp

```

```csharp
