# ERC1155SignatureMintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`ISignatureMintERC1155`](/contracts/ISignatureMintERC1155) interfaces.

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/sdk/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) of NFTs.

## generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of NFTs.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

The `mintRequest` object you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `quantity`, `to`, and `metadata` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

```csharp

```

#### to (required)

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

```csharp

```

#### metadata (required)

The metadata of the NFT to mint.

Can either be a `string` URL that points to valid metadata that conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
or an object that conforms to the same standards.

If you provide an object, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

```csharp

```

#### currencyAddress (optional)

The address of the currency to pay for minting the tokens (use the [`price`](#price-optional) field to specify the price).

Defaults to `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (the native currency of the network, e.g. Ether on Ethereum).

```csharp

```

#### price (optional)

If you want the user to pay for minting the tokens, you can specify the price **per token**.

Defaults to `0` (free minting).

```javascript
const signature = await contract.erc1155.signature.generate({
  quantity: "{{quantity}}",
  to: "{{wallet_address}}",
  metadata: {
    // ... Your NFT metadata
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  price: "{{price}}", // The user will have to pay `price * quantity` for minting the tokens
});
```

#### mintStartTime (optional)

The time from which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `Date.now()` (now).

```csharp

```

#### mintEndTime (optional)

The time until which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10),` (10 years from now).

```csharp

```

#### primarySaleRecipient (optional)

If a `price` is specified, the funds will be sent to the `primarySaleRecipient` address.

Defaults to the `primarySaleRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyBps (optional)

The percentage fee you want to charge for secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyBps` of the contract.

```csharp

```

#### royaltyRecipient (optional)

The address that will receive the royalty fees from secondary sales.

Defaults to the `royaltyRecipient` address of the contract.

```csharp

```

## generateBatch

Generate a batch of signatures at once.

This is the same as [`generate`](#generate) but it allows you to generate multiple signatures at once.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### payloadsToSign

An array of objects containing the configuration options for each signature.

See [`generate`](#generate) for the configuration options available for each signature.

</div>
</details>

## generateFromTokenId

Generate a signature that can be used to mint additional supply of an existing NFT in the contract.

This is the same as [`generate`](#generate) but it allows you to specify the `tokenId` of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for, rather than
providing the `metadata` of the NFT. Each other configuration option is the same as [`generate`](#generate).

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

The configuration options available are the same as those in [`generate`](#generate) except for replacing `metadata` with `tokenId`.

#### tokenId

The `tokenId` of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for.

```csharp

```

</div>
</details>

## generateBatchFromTokenIds

Generate a batch of signatures that can be used to mint additional supply of existing NFTs in the contract.

This is the same as [`generateBatch`](#generatebatch) but allows you to generate multiple signatures at once.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

Provide an array of objects containing the configuration options for each signature.

See [`generateFromTokenId`](#generatefromtokenid) for the configuration options available for each signature.

</div>
</details>

## mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature (required)

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

Must be of type `SignedPayload1155`.

```javascript
// Use the signed payload to mint the tokens
const txResult = contract.erc1155.signature.mint(
  // highlight-next-line
  signature, // Signature generated by the `generate` function
);
```

</div>
</details>

## mintBatch

Use multiple signatures at once to mint tokens.

This is the same as [`mint`](#mint) but it allows you to provide multiple signatures at once.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signatures (required)

An array of signatures created by the [`generate`](#generate) or [`generateBatch`](#generatebatch) functions.

Must be of type `SignedPayload1155[]`.

</div>
</details>

## verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload, and prove that it was valid and was generated
by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint`/`mintBatch` functions will fail,
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp

```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### payload (required)

The payload to verify.

Must be of type `SignedPayload1155`.

### Return Value

Returns `true` if the payload is valid, `false` otherwise.

```csharp

```

</div>
