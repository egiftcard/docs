Deploys a Smart Wallet for the user to interact with your app. The specified personal wallet will be the admin signer.
For more information about Smart Wallets, see [glossary](/glossary/smart-wallet).

## Usage

```csharp
using Thirdweb;

public async void ConnectWallet()
{
    // Reference to your Thirdweb SDK
    var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;

    // Configure the connection
    var connection = new WalletConnection(
      provider: WalletProvider.SmartWallet,        // The wallet provider you want to connect to (Required)
      chainId: 1,                                  // The chain you want to connect to (Required)
      password: "myEpicPassword",                  // If using a local wallet as personal wallet (Optional)
      email: "email@email.com",                    // If using a personal wallet login option that requires email (Optional)
      personalWallet: WalletProvider.LocalWallet   // The personal wallet you want to use with your Smart Wallet (Optional)
    );

    // Connect the wallet
    string address = await sdk.wallet.Connect(connection);
}
```

## Behavior

### WebGL

Goes through the specified `personalWallet` login flow, then generates or connects a Smart Wallet based on that EOA address.

### Standalone

Goes through the specified `personalWallet` login flow, then generates or connects a Smart Wallet based on that EOA address.

### Mobile

Goes through the specified `personalWallet` login flow, then generates or connects a Smart Wallet based on that EOA address.

## Miscellaneous

The ultimate goal of a Smart Wallet is to be able to sponsor gas fees for your users, while providing a signless and gasless experience.

They also work with any wallet provider as the EOA, but it is recommended to use a signless wallet, like Embedded Wallets, for the best experience.

You would then be able to login to the exact same persistent EOA and smart wallet address across your apps, and even across different platforms.

## Additional Options

Smart wallets, through paymasters, can be seen as a "plugin" to your user wallets, whereby all gas fees can be sponsored onchain.
To enable this, simply set the `gasless` smart wallet option to true in your [ThirdwebManager](/unity/thirdwebmanager) prefab.

All Smart Wallets are deployed through an [Account Factory](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory), which is a contract that deploys Smart Wallets on behalf of your users.
You would need to set this address in your [ThirdwebManager](/unity/thirdwebmanager) prefab's Smart Wallet settings as well.
