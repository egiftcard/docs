Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/sdk.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a `Wallet` object.

The [`@thirdweb-dev/wallets`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/wallets) package provides a set
of wallets for you to use to instantiate the SDK.

It includes support for secret manager services
such as [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) and [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

This is the recommended method to instantiate the SDK in a production environment.

## Usage

First, install the [`@thirdweb-dev/wallets`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/wallets) package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb/wallets
```

Then, you can use the `ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet` method to instantiate the SDK.

Below is an example of how to instantiate the SDK with the [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import { AwsKmsWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new AwsKmsWallet({
  region: "us-east-1",
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  sessionToken: process.env.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN,
  keyId: process.env.AWS_KEY_ID,
});

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "ethereum");
```

## Configuration

### chain

The chain you want to use. See [configuring chain](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#chain-required)
on the `ThirdwebSDK` for more information.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const wallet = {
  // ... Your wallet implementation
};

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(
  wallet,
  // highlight-next-line
  "ethereum", // Can be a string, a Chain object from @thirdweb-dev/chains, or a custom chain.
);
```

### Using AwsKmsWallet

Use [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to instantiate the SDK.

The value stored in your secret value should be your wallet&rsquo;s private key.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import { AwsKmsWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new AwsKmsWallet({
  region: "us-east-1", // Region where your secret is stored
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
  sessionToken: process.env.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
  keyId: process.env.AWS_KEY_ID, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
});

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "ethereum");
```

### Using AwsSecretsManagerWallet

Use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) to instantiate the SDK.

The value stored in your secret value should be your wallet&rsquo;s private key.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import { AwsSecretsManagerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new AwsSecretsManagerWallet({
  secretId: "{{secret-id}}", // ID of the secret value
  secretKeyName: "{{secret-key-name}}", // Name of the secret value
  awsConfig: {
    region: "us-east-1", // Region where your secret is stored
    credentials: {
      accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
      secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, // Add environment variables to store your AWS credentials
    },
  },
});

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "ethereum");
```
