---

Send a raw transaction to the blockchain from the connected wallet.

## Usage

Create a `TransactionRequest` object with the raw transaction data, and pass it to this method.

The method will return the transaction receipt once the transaction is mined.

```javascript
const txResult = await sdk.wallet.sendRawTransaction({
  accessList: [], // The AccessList to include; only available for EIP-2930 and EIP-1559 transactions.
  blockTag: "latest", // A BlockTag specifies a specific block location in the Blockchain.
  ccipReadEnabled: false, // https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#use-of-ccip-read-for-transactions
  customData: {}, // The transaction data.
  from: "0x...", // The address this transaction is from.
  gasLimit: 100000, // The maximum amount of gas this transaction is permitted to use.
  gasPrice: 100000, // The price (in wei) per unit of gas this transaction will pay.
  maxFeePerGas: 100000, // The maximum price (in wei) per unit of gas this transaction will pay
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: 0, // The price (in wei) per unit of gas this transaction will allow in addition to the block's base fee
  nonce: 0, // The nonce used as part of the proof-of-work to mine this block.
  type: 0, // The EIP-2718 type of this transaction envelope, or undefined for to use the network default
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"), // send 0.1 ether with the contract call
});
```
