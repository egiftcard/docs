```javascript
// This is the message to be signed
const message = "Sign this message...";

// Now we can sign the message with the connected wallet
const signature = await sdk.wallet.sign(message);
```

## Configuration

### message

The message to be signed.

```javascript
const message = "Sign this message...";
```

## Return Value

```
