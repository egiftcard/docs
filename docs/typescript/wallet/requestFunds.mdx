---

Request funds from a running [local node](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#local-nodes) to the currently connected wallet.

## Usage

Request funds from a running local node (`Localhost` or `Hardhat`) to the currently connected wallet.

This is useful for when you want to deploy smart contracts from your _own_ wallet to a local node, rather than importing one of the provided accounts from a tool such as Hardhat.

Under the hood, this method simply transfers funds from a public test account to the currently connected wallet.

```javascript
// Request 1 Ether from the local node
const receipt = await sdk.wallet.requestFunds(1);
```

## Configuration

### amount

The amount of tokens you want to (e.g. Ether on Ethereum) to request.

Must be a `string`, `number` or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
// Request 1 Ether from the local node
const receipt = await sdk.wallet.requestFunds("{{amount}}");
```
