# Deterministic Deployments With CREATE2

Thirdweb SDK provides utility functions for deploying a contract deterministically.
This allows predictable addresses on any EVM chain, as long as same salt is used for deploying the contract.

The deployment transaction will go through a Create2 factory, which will in turn deploy the contract with the given bytecode and salt. This ensures that the contract address is deterministic (same on many chains), and can be predicted in advance.

While the addresses are deterministic, it can't be ensured that those will be same on all chains. The address is dependent on the Create2 factory address, which is dependent on some chain specific factors such as EIP155 enforcement, base fee, etc.

However, using these utility functions, you can predict the address where the contract will be deployed
