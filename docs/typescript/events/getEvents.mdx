title: getEvents
slug: /sdk.contractevents.getevents
---

Get a list of a specific event emitted from the contract during a specified time period.

## Usage

Provide the name of the event, and an optional filter to define the time period to get events for.

```javascript
// The name of the event to get logs for
const eventName = "Transfer";

const events = await contract.events.getEvents(eventName);
```

## Configuration

### eventName

The name of the event to get logs for.

In Solidity, an event is triggered by the `emit` keyword.

```solidity title="Example.sol"
// An example Solidity contract
emit Transfer(); // Triggering event
```

To listen to this event, use the name of the event as it appears in the contract.

```javascript
const events = await contract.events.getEvents(
  // highlight-next-line
  "Transfer",
);
```

### filters (optional)

An optinal object containing the `fromBlock` and `toBlock` numbers for the time period to get events for.

The `order` field indicates the ordering of the events; `desc` (descending) or `asc` (ascending).

The `filters` field allows you to filter on [indexed event parameters](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/contracts.html#index-14).

The default `fromBlock` is `0` and the default `toBlock` is `latest`.

```javascript
const options = {
  // highlight-start
  fromBlock: 0,
  toBlock: 1000000,
  order: "desc",
  filters: {
    from: "0x...",
    to: "0x...",
  },
  // highlight-end
};

const events = await contract.events.getEvents(eventName, options);
```

## Return Value

Returns an array of `ContractEvent` objects, containing the following properties:

```typescript
{
  eventName: string;
  data: TEvent;
  transaction: {
    blockNumber: number;
    blockHash: string;
    transactionIndex: number;
    removed: boolean;
    address: string;
    data: string;
    topics: Array<string>;
    transactionHash: string;
    logIndex: number;
  }
}
[];
```
