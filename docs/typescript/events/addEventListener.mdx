Create a new subscription to a [smart contract&rsquo;s](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/structure-of-a-contract.html#events) events being emitted.

## Usage

Use the name of the event as it appears on the smart contract to subscribe to it.

In the example below, the listener will be called whenever the `TokensMinted` event is emitted by the contract.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addEventListener(
  "TokensMinted",
  (event) => {
    // Perform some logic when the event is emitted
    console.log(event);
  },
);
```

## Configuration

### eventName

The name of the event to listen to.

In Solidity, an event is triggered by the `emit` keyword.

```solidity title="Example.sol"
// An example Solidity contract
emit TokensMinted(); // Triggering event
```

To listen to this event, use the name of the event as it appears in the contract.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addEventListener(
  // highlight-next-line
  "TokensMinted",
  (event) => {}, // Perform some logic
);
```

### listener

The callback function to be called when the event is emitted.

The function comes with an `event` parameter that contains the event data, in the type of `Record<string, any>`, (an object).

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addEventListener(
  "TokensMinted",
  // highlight-start
  (event) => {
    console.log(event);
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

## Return Value

Returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe the listener.

To stop listening to events, call the function.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addEventListener(
  "TokensMinted",
  (event) => {
    console.log(event);
  },
);

// Stop listening to the events
unsubscribe();
```
