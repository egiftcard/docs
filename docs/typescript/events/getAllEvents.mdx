title: getAllEvents
slug: /sdk.contractevents.getallevents
---

Get a list of all the events emitted from the contract during a specified time period.

## Usage

By default, the method gets all events from block `0` to the latest block, in descending order.

```javascript
const events = await contract.events.getAllEvents();
```

## Configuration

### filters (optional)

An object containing the `fromBlock` and `toBlock` numbers for the time period to get events for.

The `order` field indicates the ordering of the events; `desc` (descending) or `asc` (ascending).

The default `fromBlock` is `0` and the default `toBlock` is `latest`.

```javascript
const filters = {
  // highlight-start
  fromBlock: 0,
  toBlock: 1000000,
  order: "desc",
  // highlight-end
};

const events = await contract.events.getAllEvents(filters);
```

## Return Value

Returns an array of `ContractEvent` objects, containing the following properties:

```typescript
{
  eventName: string;
  data: TEvent;
  transaction: {
    blockNumber: number;
    blockHash: string;
    transactionIndex: number;
    removed: boolean;
    address: string;
    data: string;
    topics: Array<string>;
    transactionHash: string;
    logIndex: number;
  }
}
[];
```
