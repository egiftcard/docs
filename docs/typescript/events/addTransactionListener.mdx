Subscribe to all transactions in the contract.

## Usage

Register a listener that will be called whenever a transaction occurs in the contract.

The listener will be called with an `event` object that contains the status of the transaction (`submitted` and `completed`) as well as the transaction hash.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addTransactionListener((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

## Configuration

### listener

The callback function to be called when a transaction is sent to the contract.

The function comes with an `event` parameter that contains the transaction's status (`submitted` and `completed`) and hash.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addTransactionListener(
  // highlight-start
  (event) => {
    console.log(event);
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

## Return Value

Returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe the listener.

To stop listening to transactions, call the function.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = contract.events.addTransactionListener((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// Stop listening to the events
unsubscribe();
```
