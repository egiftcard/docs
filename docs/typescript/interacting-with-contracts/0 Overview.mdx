# Extensions

Each [extension](/contractkit/interfaces) _(i.e. Solidity interface)_ that your smart contract implements unlocks new functionality for you to use in the SDK.
For example, NFT collection smart contracts implements the [ERC721](/contractkit/interfaces/IERC721) extension,
allowing you can to use the [ERC721](/typescript/extensions/erc721) extension in the SDK when interacting with that contract.

These extension interfaces are available for the most common EIP standards, including support for ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, permissions, metadata,
and more. They handle the pre-processing of calling the smart contract functions for you, such as checking for token approval, uploading metadata to IPFS, formatting inputs, etc.
Making your code safer and easier to write.

For interacting with non-standard smart contracts, the [`call`](TODO) function can be used to call any function on the contract.
