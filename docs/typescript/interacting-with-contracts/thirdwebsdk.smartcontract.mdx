title: Connect to a Contract
slug: /sdk.thirdwebsdk.smartcontract
---

Connect to a deployed smart contract to start interacting with it.

The ABI of the smart contract is resolved automatically for contracts deployed or imported
using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

## Usage

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK in either read or read-write mode
const sdk = new ThirdWebSDK("ethereum");

// Connect to your smart contract using the contract address.
const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");
```

:::tip Generate

To preload the ABI of the smart contract, run [npx thirdweb generate](/cli/generate) in your project.

This is recommended to improve performance and provide type-safety when interacting with your smart contract.

:::

## Configuration

### address (required)

The address of the smart contract you want to connect to.

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract(
  // highlight-next-line
  "0x...", // The address of your smart contract
);
```

:::info Import
If your smart contract was not deployed using thirdweb, you&rsquo;ll need to import it using the [dashboard](/dashboard), or provide
the [ABI](#abi) as a second parameter.
:::

### abi (optional)

Optionally, (if you don&rsquo;t want to use the import feature),
you can provide your smart contract&rsquo;s ABI to the second parameter of the `getContract` method.
Useful when developing on a [local node](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#local-nodes),
where it may be faster to use the ABI than to import the contract using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

The ABI is only necessary if you have not deployed your contract with, or imported your contract
to the thirdweb dashboard.

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract(
  "0x...", // The address of your smart contract
  // highlight-next-line
  abi, // The ABI of your smart contract
);
```

### Return Value

<details>
<summary>Return Value</summary>
<div>

The `getContract` method returns an instance of the `SmartContract` class.

This class contains all the possible high level extension functionality, but each extension can only be used if your contract implements them. When trying to call an extension function on a contract that does not implement it, the SDK will inform you of the missing extension to implement.

Raw contract functions can also be called using the `contract.call("functionName", [...args], optionalOverrides)` API.

To get a full list of SDK functions available for a contract, consult the corresponing contract page on the dashboard: `https://thirdweb.com/<chain>/<contractAddress>`
