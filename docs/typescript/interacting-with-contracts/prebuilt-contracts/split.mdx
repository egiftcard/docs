When using the [Split](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Split) smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `split` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract(
  "{{contract_address}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "split", // Provide the "split" contract type
);
```

- [Permissions](/typescript/sdk.permissions)
- [ContractMetadata](/typescript/sdk.contractmetadata)
- [Gasless](/typescript/sdk.gasless)
