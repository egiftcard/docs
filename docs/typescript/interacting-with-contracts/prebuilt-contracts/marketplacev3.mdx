When using the smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `marketplace-v3` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract(
  "{{contract_address}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "marketplace-v3", // Provide the "marketplace-v3" contract type
);
```

Once connected, the capabilities unique to the Marketplace V3 are available from the following extensions:

- [DirectListings](/typescript/sdk.directlistings)
- [EnglishAuctions](/typescript/sdk.englishauctions)
- [Offers](/typescript/sdk.offers)
