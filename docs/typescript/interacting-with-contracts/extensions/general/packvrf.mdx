# PackVRF

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IPackVRFDirect`](/contracts/IPackVRFDirect) interface;
the [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) variation of the pack interface.

## addPackOpenEventListener

Create an event listener that calls a `callback` function whenever a pack is opened on the contract.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = await contract.vrf.addPackOpenEventListener(
  (packId, openerAddress, rewards) => {
    console.log(
      `Pack ${packId} was opened by ${openerAddress} and contained:, ${rewards})`,
    );
  },
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### callback

The function to run whenever the event is emitted.

Contains three parameters that you can use to access the event data:

- `packId` - The ID of the pack that was opened. `string`.
- `openerAddress` - The address of the account that opened the pack. `string`.
- `rewards` - The rewards that were claimed from the pack. Type below:
  ```typescript
  {
    erc20Rewards?: {
        contractAddress: string;
        quantityPerReward: string | number;
    }[] | undefined;
    erc721Rewards?: {
        tokenId: string | number | bigint | BigNumber;
        contractAddress: string;
    }[] | undefined;
    erc1155Rewards?: {
        tokenId: string | number | bigint | BigNumber;
        contractAddress: string;
        quantityPerReward: string | number | bigint | BigNumber;
    }[] | undefined;
  }
  ```

</div>
</details>

## canClaimRewards

Check if a specific wallet can claim rewards after opening a pack.

```javascript
const canClaim = await contract.vrf.canClaimRewards("{{wallet_address}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (optional)

The address of the wallet to check. If not provided, the currently connected wallet will be used.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

A `boolean` indicating whether the wallet can claim rewards.

```typescript
boolean;
```

</div>
</details>

## claimRewards

Claim the rewards from an opened pack.

Use [`canClaimRewards`](#canclaimrewards) to check if the wallet can claim rewards before calling this method.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.vrf.claimRewards();
```

## getLinkBalance

Get the LINK balance of the contract.

```javascript
const linkBalance = await contract.vrf.getLinkBalance();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

```typescript
{
  symbol: string;
  value: BigNumber;
  name: string;
  decimals: number;
  displayValue: string;
}
```

</div>
</details>

## open

Open a pack using Chainlink VRFs random number generation.

```javascript
const result = await contract.vrf.open("{{token_id}}", "{{amount}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### tokenId

The token ID of the pack NFT to open.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

#### amount (optional)

The amount of packs to open.

If not provided, the default value of `1` will be used.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

### Return Value

This function returns a transaction result with the requestId of the open request, _not_ the contents of the pack.

To get the contents of the pack, you must call [`claimRewards`](#claimrewards) once the VRF request has been fulfilled

</div>
</details>

## openAndClaim

Open a pack and claim the rewards.

This function will start the flow of opening a pack.
The rewards will be granted automatically to the connected address after VRF request is fulfilled.

This is essentially a shortcut for calling [`open`](#open) and [`claimRewards`](#claimrewards) in sequence.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.vrf.openAndClaim("{{token_id}}", "{{amount}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### tokenId

The token ID of the pack NFT to open.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

#### amount (optional)

The amount of packs to open.

If not provided, the default value of `1` will be used.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

#### gasLimit (optional)

The gas limit to use for the VRF callback transaction, defaults to `500000`.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

</div>
</details>

## transferLink

Transfer LINK to this contract.

Note: the wallet that initiates this transaction must have the amount of LINK specified in the `amount` parameter.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.vrf.transferLink("{{amount}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.
