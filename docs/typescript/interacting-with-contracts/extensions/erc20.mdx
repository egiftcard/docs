// Address of the wallet to check token allowance
const spenderAddress = "0x...";
const allowance = await contract.erc20.allowance(spenderAddress);
```

## allowanceOf

```javascript
// Address of the wallet who owns the funds
const owner = "{{wallet_address}}";
// Address of the wallet to check token allowance
const spender = "0x...";
const allowance = await contract.erc20.allowanceOf(owner, spender);
```

## balance

```

## balanceOf

## get

## setAllowance

```javascript
// Address of the wallet to allow transfers from
const spenderAddress = "0x...";
// The number of tokens to give as allowance
const amount = 100;
await contract.erc20.setAllowance(spenderAddress, amount);
```

## totalSupply

```javascript
const balance = await contract.erc20.totalSupply();
```

## transfer

const toAddress = "0x...";
// The amount of tokens you want to send
const amount = 0.1;
await contract.erc20.transfer(toAddress, amount);
```

## transferFrom

Transfer Tokens From Address

Transfer tokens from one wallet to another

```javascript
// Address of the wallet sending the tokens
const fromAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
// Address of the wallet you want to send the tokens to
const toAddress = "0x...";
// The number of tokens you want to send
const amount = 1.2;
// Note that the connected wallet must have approval to transfer the tokens of the fromAddress
await contract.erc20.transferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
```
