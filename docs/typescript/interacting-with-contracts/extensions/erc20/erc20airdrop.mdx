# ERC20Airdrop

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`ERC20Airdrop`](/solidity/extensions) extension.

Deploy an `ERC20Airdrop` contract from the Explore page:

<div className="centered">
  <DeployThisContractButton
    link={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AirdropERC20?via=portal"}
    contractType="airdrop-erc20"
  />
</div>

## drop

Airdrop [ERC20](/solidity/extensions/erc20) tokens to multiple recipients.

```typescript
// Airdrop content array, with recipients and token amounts
const contents = [
  {
    recipient: "0xabc...", // first recipient address
    amount: "10", // number of tokens in wei units
  },
  {
    recipient: "0x123...", // second recipient address
    amount: "20", // number of tokens in wei units
  },
];

const tokenAddress = "0x..."; // Address of the ERC20 token being airdropped
const tokenOwner = "0x..."; // Address of the owner of the tokens being airdropped

const output = await contract.airdrop20.drop(
  tokenAddress,
  tokenOwner,
  contents,
);

// the `output` return value above contains:
//     - count of successful and failed drops
//     - array containing failed drops, if any
```

### Return Value

The `drop` function returns an array of recipients for who the airdrop failed (empty means all transfers were successful).
