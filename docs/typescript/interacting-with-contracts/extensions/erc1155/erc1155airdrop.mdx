    contractType="airdrop-erc1155"
  />
</div>

## drop

Airdrop [ERC1155](/soldity/extensions/erc1155) tokens to multiple recipients.

```javascript
  // Airdrop content array, with recipients and tokenIds
  const contents = [
       {
         recipient: "0xabc...", // first recipient address
         tokenId: 0,
         amount: "10" // number of tokens
       },
       {
         recipient: "0x123...", // second recipient address
         tokenId: 0
         amount: "20" // number of tokens
       }
    ]

  const tokenAddress = "0x..." // Address of the ERC1155 token being airdropped
  const tokenOwner = "0x..." // Address of the owner of the tokens being airdropped

  const output = await contract.airdrop1155.drop(tokenAddress, tokenOwner, contents);

  // the `output` return value above contains:
  //     - count of successful and failed drops
  //     - array containing failed drops, if any

```
