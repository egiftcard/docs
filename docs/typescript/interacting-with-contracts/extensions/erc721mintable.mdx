# ERC721Mintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC721`](/contracts/IERC721) and
[`IMintableERC721`](/contracts/IBurnableERC721) interfaces.

Allows you to mint new NFTs on the contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata object instead of an object.

## mint

Mint a new NFT to the **connected wallet**.

```javascript
// Custom metadata of the NFT, note that you can fully customize this metadata with other properties.
const metadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT #1",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
  // ... Any other metadata you want to include
};

const txResult = await contract.erc721.mint(metadata);
```

### Configuration

#### metadata

Either provide a `string` that points to [valid metadata object](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure)
or an object containing the metadata.

The `image` property can be an IPFS URI, a URL, or a `File` object.

If a file is provided for the image, it will also be uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.

_Using a string_:

```javascript
// Option 1: Provide a string that points to valid metadata object
var metadata = "https://example.com/metadata.json";
```

_Using an object_:

```javascript
// Option 2: Provide a metadata object, which will be uploaded and pinned to IPFS for you.
const metadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT #1",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
  // ... Any other metadata you want to include
};
```

Provide the metadata to the `mint` function:

```javascript
// Either the string or the object can be provided to the mint function
const txResult = await contract.erc721.mint(metadata);
```

## mintTo

The same as [`mint`](#mint), but allows you to specify the address of the wallet that will receive the NFT rather than using
the connected wallet address.

```javascript
// Address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to
// highlight-next-line
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

// Custom metadata of the NFT, note that you can fully customize this metadata with other properties.
const metadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
};

const txResult = await contract.erc721.mintTo(walletAddress, metadata);
```

### Configuration

#### walletAddress

The address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to.

```javascript
// highlight-next-line
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

const metadata = {
  // ...
};

const txResult = await contract.erc721.mintTo(walletAddress, metadata);
```

#### metadata

See [`metadata`](#metadata) configuration above.
