# ERC721LazyMintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC721`](/contracts/IERC721) and
[`ILazyMint`](/contracts/ILazyMint)
interfaces.

Allows you to lazy mint new batches of NFTs to be claimed in the future.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before lazy-minting. You can override this default behavior by providing an array of URLs as `string`s
that point to valid metadata objects.

## lazyMint

Define an array of metadata objects that you want to lazy-mint.

```javascript
// Custom metadata of the NFTs you want to mint.
const metadatas = [
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #1",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #2",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
];

const txResult = await contract.erc721.lazyMint(metadatas); // uploads and creates the NFTs on chain
```

An array of metadata objects for the NFTs you want to mint.

Must be an `array` of `object`s that conform to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).
Alternatively, you can provide an array of `string`s that point to valid metadata objects,
to override the default behavior of uploading and pinning the metadata to IPFS (shown below).

```javascript
// highlight-start
const metadatas = [
  "https://example.com/metadata1.json",
  "ipfs://my-ipfs-hash",
  "https://some-other-url.com/metadata2.json",
];
// highlight-end

const txResult = await contract.erc721.lazyMint(metadatas);
```
