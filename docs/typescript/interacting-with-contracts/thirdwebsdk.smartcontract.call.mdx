# Call Functions

If the functionality of your smart contract does not come under one of the [extension interfaces](/typescript/extensions#extensions),
you can use the generic `call` method to call any function on the smart contract. This works for both read and write operations.

- If your function is a **read** operation, i.e. no transaction takes place, you can get the data returned by that function call by awaiting the result of the `call`.
- If your function is a **write** operation, i.e. a transaction is required, the result of that transaction can be read by awaiting the result of the `call`.
  The call will be awaited until the transaction is mined and the transaction receipt is available.

## Usage

```javascript
const data = await contract.call(
  "myFunctionName", // Name of your function as it is on the smart contract
  // Arguments to your function, in the same order they are on your smart contract
  [
    "arg1", // e.g. Argument 1
    "arg2", // e.g. Argument 2
  ],
);
```

## Configuration

### functionName

The name of the function, view, mapping, variable, etc. on your smart contract.

```javascript
const data = await contract.call(
  // highlight-next-line
  "myFunctionName", // Name of your function as it is on the smart contract
);
```

### args

The arguments to the function/variable, in the same order they are on your smart contract.

If you provide too few or too many arguments, the function will throw an error.

```javascript
const data = await contract.call(
  "myFunctionName", // Name of your function as it is on the smart contract
  // highlight-start
  [
    "arg1", // e.g. Argument 1
    "arg2", // e.g. Argument 2
  ],
  // highlight-end
);
```

### overrides

Optionally override the default transaction options by providing an overrides object as the final, additional argument.

```javascript
const data = await contract.call(
  "myFunctionName", // Name of your function as it is on the smart contract
  [
    "arg1", // e.g. Argument 1
    "arg2", // e.g. Argument 2
  ],
  // highlight-start
  {
    gasLimit: 1000000, // override default gas limit
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"), // send 0.1 ether with the contract call
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```
