slug: /sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromprivatekey
---

Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/sdk.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a wallet&rsquo;s private key.

All transactions made with this instance of the SDK will be signed using the private key.

## Usage

Provide the private key as a string and the [chain](#chain) you want to use.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, "ethereum");
```

## Configuration

### privateKey

The [private key](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#externally-owned-accounts-and-key-pairs)
of the wallet you want to use to initiate transactions with.

:::danger Sensitive Value

The private key grants custody over the funds associated with your account.

Losing or leaking your private key will result in the loss of your funds.

Please proceed carefully, and consider using a [secret manager](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromwallet) instead.

:::

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  // highlight-next-line
  "your-private-key-here", // DANGER: This is a sensitive value that should be stored securely.
  "ethereum",
);
```

### chain

The chain you want to use. See [configuring chain](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#chain-required)
on the `ThirdwebSDK` for more information.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // DANGER: This is a sensitive value that should be stored securely.
  // highlight-next-line
  "ethereum", // Can be a string, a Chain object from @thirdweb-dev/chains, or a custom chain.
);
```
