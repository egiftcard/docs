Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a wallet&rsquo;s private key.

All transactions made with this instance of the SDK will be signed using the private key.

## Usage

Provide the private key as a string and the [chain](#chain) you want to use.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, "ethereum", {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Use client id if using on the client side, get it from dashboard settings
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // Use secret key if using on the server, get it from dashboard settings
});
```

## Configuration

### Client ID or Secret Key(required)

To use the Typescript SDK, you need to obtain either the `clientId` or `secretKey` from an API key which you can obtain from the [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). You can instatiate the SDK in two ways:

- **Client-side**: Use the SDK in the browser or mobile app. In this instance, you would use the `clientId` prop.
- **Server-side**: Use the SDK in a server environment. In this instance, you would use the `secretKey` prop.

### privateKey

The [private key](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#externally-owned-accounts-and-key-pairs)
of the wallet you want to use to initiate transactions with.

:::danger Sensitive Value

The private key grants custody over the funds associated with your account.

Losing or leaking your private key will result in the loss of your funds.

Please proceed carefully, and consider using a [secret manager](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromwallet) instead.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  // highlight-next-line
  "your-private-key-here", // DANGER: This is a sensitive value that should be stored securely.
  "ethereum",
  {
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Use client id if using on the client side, get it from dashboard settings
    secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // Use secret key if using on the server, get it from dashboard settings
  },
);
```

### chain

The chain you want to use. See [configuring chain](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#chain-required)
on the `ThirdwebSDK` for more information.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // DANGER: This is a sensitive value that should be stored securely.
  // highlight-next-line
  "ethereum", // Can be a string, a Chain object from @thirdweb-dev/chains, or a custom chain.
);
```
