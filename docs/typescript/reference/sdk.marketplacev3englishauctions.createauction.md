## Example

```javascript
// Data of the auction you want to create
const auction = {
  // address of the contract of the asset you want to auction
  assetContractAddress: "0x...",
  // token ID of the asset you want to auction
  tokenId: "0",
  // how many of the asset you want to auction
  quantity: 1,
  // address of the currency contract that will be used to pay for the auctioned tokens
  currencyContractAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  // the minimum bid that will be accepted for the token
  minimumBidAmount: "1.5",
  // how much people would have to bid to instantly buy the asset
  buyoutBidAmount: "10",
  // If a bid is made less than these many seconds before expiration, the expiration time is increased by this.
  timeBufferInSeconds: "900", // 15 minutes by default
  // A bid must be at least this much bps greater than the current winning bid
  bidBufferBps: "500", // 5% by default
  // when should the auction open up for bidding
  startTimestamp: new Date(Date.now()),
  // end time of auction
  endTimestamp: new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
};

const tx = await contract.englishAuctions.createAuction(auction);
const receipt = tx.receipt; // the transaction receipt
const id = tx.id; // the id of the newly created auction
```
