title: upload
slug: /sdk.storage.upload
---

Upload arbitrary file or JSON data using the configured decentralized storage system (IPFS with pinning by default).

## Usage

Upload file or JSON data to the decentralized storage system.

If uploading a JSON object, the method will automatically upload any file data within the object and replace it with a hash.

```jsx
const data = { name: "Hello world" };
const uri = await sdk.storage.upload(data);
```

## Configuration

### data

The data you want to upload.

Accepts any data type (File, object, string, etc).

By default, the data is uploaded and **pinned** to IPFS for you.

### options (optional)

Customize the upload behaviour by passing in an options object as the second parameter.

```javascript
const uri = await sdk.storage.upload(
  { name: "Hello world" },
  {
    alwaysUpload: false, // Optionally, always reupload even if the file already exists
    onProgress: (progress) => {}, // Callback that gets triggered when file upload progresses
    metadata: {}, // Optional metadata to associate with this upload
    rewriteFileNames: undefined, // If specified, will rewrite file names to numbers for use on-chain. Useful to use with NFT contracts that map token IDs to files.
    uploadWithGatewayUrl: false, // If specified, any URLs with schemes will be replaced with resolved URLs before upload
    uploadWithoutDirectory: false, // If specified, will upload a single file without wrapping it in a directory
  },
);
```

## Return Value

Returns the URI of the uploaded data.

```typescript
string;
```
