title: ThirdwebSDK.fromSigner
slug: /sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromsigner
---

Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/).

This is useful when using the SDK on the client-side, such as when using our [React SDK](/react).

Use the [`useSigner`](/react/react.usesigner) hook to get the currently connected wallet&rsquo;s signer on the client.

The SDK will be instantiated on the [chain](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#chain-required) that the signer is connected to.

## Usage

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// An example of a signer using the ethers library
import ethers from "ethers";
const signer = new ethers.Wallet("{{private_key}}");

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromSigner(signer, "ethereum", {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Use client id if using on the client side, get it from dashboard settings
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // Use secret key if using on the server, get it from dashboard settings. Do NOT expose your secret key to the client-side
});
```

## Configuration

### Signer (required)

The `Signer` is an object that represents an Ethereum account. It is used to sign transactions and messages. The SDK uses the `Signer` to sign transactions and messages.

### Network (required)

The network that you want to connect to. This could be a thirdweb's chain slug (`"ethereum"`| `"polygon"`, `"..."`), chain ID (`1`, `137`, `"..."`) or an RPC URL

### Client ID or Secret Key(required)

To use the Typescript SDK, you need to obtain either the `clientId` or `secretKey` from an API key which you can obtain from the [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). You can instatiate the SDK in two ways:

- **Client-side**: Use the SDK in the browser or mobile app. In this instance, you would use the `clientId` prop.
- **Server-side**: Use the SDK in a server environment. In this instance, you would use the `secretKey` prop.
