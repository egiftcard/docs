Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/sdk.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/).

This is useful when using the SDK on the client-side, such as when using our [React SDK](/react).

Use the [`useSigner`](/react/react.usesigner) hook to get the currently connected wallet&rsquo;s signer on the client.

The SDK will be instantiated on the [chain](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk#chain-required) that the signer is connected to.

## Usage

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// An example of a signer using the ethers library
import ethers from "ethers";
const signer = new ethers.Wallet("{{private_key}}");

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromSigner(signer);
```
