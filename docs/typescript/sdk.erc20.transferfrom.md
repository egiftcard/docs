# Erc20.transferFrom property

Transfer tokens from a specific address

## Example

```javascript
// Address of the wallet sending the tokens
const fromAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
// Address of the wallet you want to send the tokens to
const toAddress = "0x...";
// The number of tokens you want to send
const amount = 1.2;
// Note that the connected wallet must have approval to transfer the tokens of the fromAddress
await contract.erc20.transferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
transferFrom: {
        (from: string, to: string, amount: string | number): Promise<Omit<{
            receipt: ethers.providers.TransactionReceipt;
            data: () => Promise<unknown>;
        }, "data">>;
        prepare: (from: string, to: string, amount: string | number) => Promise<Transaction<Omit<{
            receipt: ethers.providers.TransactionReceipt;
            data: () => Promise<unknown>;
        }, "data">>>;
    };
