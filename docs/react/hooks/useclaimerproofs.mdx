Hook to get the claimer proofs for an adddress for ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 based contracts.

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Drop contract as the first argument and the claimer's address as the second argument.

Optionally, you can provide a `tokenId` and `claimConditionId` to filter for a specific claim.

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "nft-drop");
  const address = useAddress();
  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    "{{claimer_address}}",
    // Optionally, you can filter by tokenId and claimConditionId
    tokenId,
    claimConditionId,
  );
}
```

## Demo Playground

Edit the code below to see how the hook works and what data is returned.

_Note: Playground uses the Goerli test network._

## Configuration

### claimerAddress

The second parameter is the `claimerAddress`. This is the address of the user you want to get the proof for.

```jsx
import { useActiveClaimCondition, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    "{{claimer_address}}", // Claimer address here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

### tokenId

The third parameter is the `tokenId`.

When using the hook with ERC1155 contracts, pass the `tokenId` as the second parameter; as each token can have unique claim conditions.

Pass `undefined`, or leave this field out if you are using ERC721 or ERC20 drop contracts.

```jsx
import { useActiveClaimCondition, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    "{{claimer_address}}",
    // highlight-start
    0, // Token ID required for ERC1155 contracts here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

### claimConditionID

The fourth paramaer is `claimConditionId`. This is the ID of the claim condition you want to get the proof for.

```jsx
import { useActiveClaimCondition, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  // "data" now includes a "snapshot" property that contains the allowlist.
  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    "{{claimer_address}}",
    undefined,
    // highlight-start
    0, // Claim condition ID here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```jsx
{
    price?: string | undefined;
    currencyAddress?: string | undefined;
    address: string;
    proof: string[];
    maxClaimable: string;
}
```
