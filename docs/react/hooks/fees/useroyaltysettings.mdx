Hook for retrieving royalty settings of a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement the [Royalty](/contractkit/extension-contracts/royalty) interface.

```jsx
import { useRoyaltySettings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your contract instance from the [`useContract`](react/hooks/usecontract) as the argument.

```jsx
import { useContract, useRoyaltySettings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement Royalty interface)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useRoyaltySettings(contract);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object with two properties:

```ts
{
  seller_fee_basis_points: number;
  fee_recipient: string;
}
```

- The `seller_fee_basis_points` is the royalty amount (in basis points) that the seller
  will receive for each token sale on secondary markets.
- The `fee_recipient` is the wallet address that will receive the royalty payments.
