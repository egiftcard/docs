Hook for connecting your app to given wallet

```jsx
import { useConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const connect = useConnect();
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useConnect, metamaskWallet() } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const metamask = metamaskWallet();

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  const handleClick = () => {
    connect(metamask, options);
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}> connect to metamask </button>;
}
```

## options

The second argument to `connect` function is wallet specific. Different wallets take different options, But - all wallets allow passing an optional `chainId` property which allows the user to connect to a specific network directly

The options object can be optional or required depending on the wallet.

### Connecting to a specific Network

If you want the user to connect to a specific network directly when connecting the wallet, you can pass the chain ID in the `options` object to the second argument

```jsx
import { useConnect, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const metamask = metamaskWallet();

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();
  const handleClick = () => {
    connect(metamask, {
      chainId: DogechainTestnet.chainId,
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}> connect to metamask </button>;
}
```

Make sure to also add this network in the `supportedChains` prop of `ThirdwebProvider` as shown below

```jsx
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[DogechainTestnet]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

:::info
It's not necessary to get the chain object from `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package.

You can also create your custom chain as mentioned [here](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#custom-chains)
