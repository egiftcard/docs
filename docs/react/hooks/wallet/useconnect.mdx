Hook for viewing the connection status and what connectors are available to be used
as defined in the [`ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s `walletConnectors` prop](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#walletconnectors).

```jsx
import { useConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const [{ data }, connect] = useConnect();
}
```

## Return Value

The data property contains an object with the following properties:

```ts
{
  connected: boolean; // Whether the user is connected to this site with their wallet
  connector: Connector<any, any> | undefined; // The connector that the user is connected with (or undefined)
  connectors: Connector<any, any>[]; // All the connectors that are available to be used
}
```

The `connect` property is a function that takes a connector as an argument
and connects the user to your dapp using that connector.

```ts
(connector: Connector<any, any>) =>
  Promise<{
    data?: ConnectorData<any> | undefined;
    error?: Error | undefined;
  }>;
```
