Hook that prompts users to connect [Paper Wallet](/wallet/paper) to your app which allows users to connect to your app using their email address

```jsx
import { usePaperWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Calling the function returned by the `usePaperWallet` hook opens the Paper Wallet's Modal and prompts the user to log in with their email address.

If `email` is not provided, the user will be prompted to enter their email address or sign in with a Google account. Once the user enters the email address or signs in with a Google account, an OTP will be sent to the user's email address. Once the user enters the OTP, the wallet will be connected.

If the email is provided, the user will be directly shown the OTP screen, the user will not be prompted to enter their email.

once connected, you can use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address and [`usePaperWalletUserEmail`](/react/react.usepaperwalletuseremail) hook to get the user's email address.

Paper SDK requires a clientId for instantiation. You can create a `clientId` for your app on [paper.xyz](https://paper.xyz/product/wallet)

```jsx
import { usePaperWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithPaperWallet = usePaperWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithPaperWallet({
          clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
          email: "<USER_EMAIL>", // optional - directly show OTP screen
        })
      }
    >
      Connect with Paper Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>chainId</summary>
  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

Paper Wallet only supports 5 chains at the moment: Ethereum (1), Polygon (137), Avalanche(43114) , Goerli (5) and Mumbai (80001). If no `chainId` is specified, Ethereum (1) is used by default.

```ts
chainId: 1 | 137 | 43114 | 5 | 80001;
```

```jsx
import { usePaperWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithPaperWallet = usePaperWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithPaperWallet({
          clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
          chainId: Polygon.chainId,
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

You must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shown below

```jsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>email</summary>
  <div>

If the user's email address is already known, you can skip prompting the user for entering an email address and directly show the OTP screen by passing the `email` in a configuration object as shown below.

```jsx
import { usePaperWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithPaperWallet = usePaperWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithPaperWallet({
          clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
          email: "user@example.com",
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
