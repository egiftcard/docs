Hook for checking whether your app is connected to a wallet or not

```jsx
import { useConnectionStatus } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectionStatus = useConnectionStatus();

  console.log(connectionStatus); //  "unknown" | "connecting" | "connected" | "disconnected"

  if (connectionStatus === "unknown") return <p> Loading... </p>;
  if (connectionStatus === "connecting") return <p> Connecting... </p>;

  return <p> Your Wallet is {status} </p>;
}
```

## Value

- connectionStatus value will always start with `"unknown"` when the application has just loaded - because SDK has not yet determined whether your app is connected to a wallet or not.

- If Application is trying to connect to a wallet, the status will be `"connecting"`. Connection to a wallet can either be because of a user action or automatically when the app is loaded with [autoconnect](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#autoconnect-optional) set to `true` in the `<ThirdwebProvider />`

- If Application is connected to a wallet, the status will be `"connected"`.

- If Application is not connected to any wallet, the status will be `"disconnected"`.
