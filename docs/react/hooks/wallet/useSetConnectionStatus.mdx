Hook for setting `connectionStatus` of the wallet.

This is only useful if you are manually connecting a wallet as mentioned in [Build your Wallet](/wallet/build-a-wallet#connecting-your-wallet-in-wallet-connection-ui)

```jsx
import { useSetConnectionStatus } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const setConnectionStatus = useSetConnectionStatus();

setConnectionStatus(status);
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSetConnectionStatus } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const setConnectionStatus = useConnectionStatus();

  const handleConnect = () => {
    setConnectionStatus("connecting");
    // manually connect to a wallet
    setConnectionStatus("connected");
  };

  const handleDisconnect = () => {
    // manually connect to a wallet
    setConnectionStatus("disconnected");
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

## Configuration
