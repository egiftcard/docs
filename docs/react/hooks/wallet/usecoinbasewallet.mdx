Hook that prompts users to connect their Coinbase Wallet to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useCoinbaseWallet` hook to prompt the user to connect their Coinbase wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useAddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithCoinbase = useCoinbaseWallet();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithCoinbase()}>Connect Coinbase</button>
  );
}
```

### Connect to a specific network

If you want the user to connect to a specific network directly when connecting the wallet, you can pass the chain ID as an argument to the `connectWithCoinbase` function as shown below.

The user will be prompted to switch to the given network after they are connected to coinbase wallet if they are not already connected to it.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
// Example Network
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithCoinbase = useCoinbaseWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithCoinbase({
          chainId: DogechainTestnet.chainId, // (568)
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Coinbase
    </button>
  );
}
```

If the given Network is not configured in the user's Coinbase wallet, the user will be prompted to Add that network in their wallet. To do this, you must add this network in ThirdwebProvider's [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shown below.

```jsx
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[DogechainTestnet]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

:::info
It's not necessary to get the chain object from `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package.

You can also create a custom chain object as mentioned [here](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#custom-chains)
