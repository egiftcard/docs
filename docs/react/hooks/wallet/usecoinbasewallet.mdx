Hook that prompts users to connect their [Coinbase Wallet](/wallet/coinbase-wallet) to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useCoinbaseWallet` hook to prompt the user to connect their Coinbase wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithCoinbase = useCoinbaseWallet();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithCoinbase()}>Connect Coinbase</button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>chainId</summary>
  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

This will prompt the user to switch to the given network after they connect.

```jsx
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Dogechain } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithCoinbase = useCoinbaseWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithCoinbase({
          chainId: Dogechain.chainId,
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Coinbase
    </button>
  );
}
```

If the chain is not configured in the user&rsquo;s wallet,
you must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Dogechain } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      // highlight-next-line
      supportedChains={[Dogechain]}
    >
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
