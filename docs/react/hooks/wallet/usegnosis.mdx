import QuickstartCard from "@components/QuickstartCard";

Hook that allows users to connect their [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) wallet to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useGnosis } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/evm/connectors/gnosis-safe";
```

## Usage

First, configure your [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#walletconnectors)'s
`walletConnectors` prop to include the Gnosis Safe connector:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { GnosisSafeConnector } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/evm/connectors/gnosis-safe";

function MyApp() {
  const gnosisSafeConnector = new GnosisSafeConnector({});

  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      activeChain={"ethereum"}
      // Configure the connectors you want to use, including your gnosisSafeConnector
      walletConnectors={[gnosisSafeConnector]}
    >
      {/* Rest of your app here */}
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Before connecting their Gnosis Safe wallet, user&rsquo;s must first:

1. Connect a personal wallet to your dApp (use [Connect Wallet Button](/react/react.connectwallet)).
2. Switch to the network the Gnosis Safe wallet is deployed to (use [`useNetwork`](/react/react.usenetwork)).

From this state, you are ready
to use the `useGnosis` hook in your app:

```jsx
import { ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { useGnosis } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/evm/connectors/gnosis-safe";

const Home = () => {
  const connectWithGnosis = useGnosis();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithGnosis({
          safeAddress: "0x...", // Smart contract address of the Gnosis Safe wallet
          safeChainId: ChainId.Mainnet, // Chain ID the Gnosis Safe wallet is deployed to
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Gnosis Safe
    </button>
  );
};
```

Then use the [`useConnect`](/react/react.useconnect) hook to determine if the Gnosis wallet is connected:

```jsx
import { useConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  // Detect if the Gnosis connector is connected
  const [connector] = useConnect();
  const activeConnector = connector.data.connector;
  const gnosisConnector = connector.data.connectors.find(
    (c) => c.id === "gnosis",
  );
  const isGnosisConnectorConnected =
    activeConnector?.id === gnosisConnector?.id;
};
```

## Full Example

A [template repository](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/gnosis-safe)
is available for you to use, which includes the full setup for:

1. Connecting user&rsquo;s personal wallets
2. Enforcing the correct network connection
3. Connecting user&rsquo;s Gnosis Safe wallets
4. Displaying the user&rsquo;s connected wallet address
5. Disconnecting user&rsquo;s wallets
