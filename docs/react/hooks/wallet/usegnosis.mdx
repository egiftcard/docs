Hook that allows users to connect their [Gnosis Safe](/wallet/safe) wallet to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useSafe } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

First, configure your [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedWallets)'s
`supportedWallets` prop to include the `safeWallet`:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, safeWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      activeChain={"ethereum"}
      // highlight-next-line
      supportedWallets={[safeWallet()]}
    >
      {/* Rest of your app here */}
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Before connecting their Gnosis Safe wallet, user&rsquo;s must first:

1. Connect a personal wallet to your dApp (use [Connect Wallet Button](/react/react.connectwallet)).
2. Switch to the network the Gnosis Safe wallet is deployed to (use [`useSwitchChain`](/react/react.useSwitchChain)).

From this state, you are ready
to use the `useSafe` hook in your app:

```jsx
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { useSafe, useWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  const connectWithGnosis = useSafe();
  const personalWallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithGnosis({
          safeAddress: "0x...", // Smart contract address of the Safe wallet
          chain: Goerli, // Chain the Safe wallet is deployed to
          personalWallet: personalWallet,
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Gnosis Safe
    </button>
  );
};
```

Then use the [`useWallet`](/react/react.usewallet) hook to determine if the Gnosis wallet is connected:

```jsx
import { useWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  const wallet = useWallet();
  const isSafeConnected = wallet && wallet.walletId === "Safe";
};
```
