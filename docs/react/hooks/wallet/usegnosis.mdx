Hook that allows users to connect their [Safe wallet](/wallet/safe) to your dApp.

Before connecting Safe wallet, a personal wallet must be connected and should be on the same network which Safe wallet is deployed to

You can connect to a personal wallet using either [useConnect](/react/react.useconnect) hook or wallet specific hook - for example: [useMetamask](/react/react.usemetamask)

From this state, you are ready
to use the `useSafe` hook in your app:

```tsx
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { useSafe, useWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { SafeWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const Home = () => {
  const connectToSafe = useSafe();
  const wallet = useWallet();
  const connectToMetamask = useMetamask(); // using metamask as personal wallet

  if (!wallet) {
    return (
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          connectToMetamask({
            chainId: Goerli.chainId,
          });
        }}
      >
        Connect personal wallet
      </button>
    );
  }

  if (wallet instanceof SafeWallet) {
    return <div>Safe wallet is connected</div>;
  }

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () =>
        await connectToSafe({
          safeAddress: "0x...", // Smart contract address of the Safe wallet
          chain: Goerli, // Chain the Safe wallet is deployed to
          personalWallet: wallet,
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Safe
    </button>
  );
};
```

The [safeWallet](/react/react.safeWallet) (with all personalWallets configured) need to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.
