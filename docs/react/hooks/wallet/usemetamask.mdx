Hook that prompts users to connect their [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Wallet to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useMetamask` hook to prompt the user to connect their MetaMask wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useAddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithMetamask()}>Connect Metamask</button>
  );
}
```

### Connect to a specific network

If you want the user to connect to a specific network directly when connecting the wallet, you can pass the chain ID as an argument to the `connectWithMetamask` function as shown below.

The user will be prompted to switch to the given network if they are not already connected to it.

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithMetamask({
          chainId: DogechainTestnet.chainId, // (568)
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Metamask
    </button>
  );
}
```

If the given Network is not configured in the user's MetaMask wallet, the user will be prompted to "Allow this site to add a network?" screen. To do this, you must add this network in ThirdwebProvider's [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shwon below.

```jsx
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[DogechainTestnet]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

:::info
It's not necessary to get the chain object from `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package.

You can also create a custom chain object as mentioned [here](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#custom-chains)
