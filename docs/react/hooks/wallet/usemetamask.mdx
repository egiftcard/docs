Hook that requests users to connect their [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Wallet to your dApp.

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the function returned by the hook to prompt the user to connect their MetaMask wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useAddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();

  return <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask</button>;
}
```

Once connected, use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the address of the connected wallet.
