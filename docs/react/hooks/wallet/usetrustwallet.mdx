Hook that prompts users to connect their Trust wallet to your app.

```jsx
import { useTrustWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

The [trustWallet](/react/react.trustWallet) also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useTrustWallet` hook to prompt the user to connect their Trust wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useTrustWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithTrust = useTrustWallet();

  return <button onClick={() => connectWithTrust()}>Connect Trust</button>;
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>chainId</summary>
  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

This will prompt the user to switch to the given network after they connect.

```jsx
import { useTrustWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Dogechain } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithTrust = useTrustWallet();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithTrust({
          chainId: Dogechain.chainId,
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

If the chain is not configured in the user&rsquo;s wallet,
you must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop:

```jsx
import { Dogechain } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Dogechain]} clientId="your-client-id">
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
