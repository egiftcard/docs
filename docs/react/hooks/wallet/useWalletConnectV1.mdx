Hook for initiating a [Wallet Connect v1](https://docs.walletconnect.com/1.0/) connection prompt for the user.

```jsx
import { useWalletConnectV1 } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useWalletConnectV1` hook to prompt the user to connect their mobile wallet to your dApp via Wallet Connect v1.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useAddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useWalletConnectV1 } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithWalletConnect = useWalletConnectV1();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithWalletConnect()}>Connect wallet</button>
  );
}
```

### Connect to a specific network

If you want the user to connect to a specific network directly when connecting the wallet, you can pass the chain ID as an argument to the `connectWithWalletConnect` function as shown below.

The user will be prompted to switch to the given network if they are not already connected to it when they connect their wallet.

```jsx
import { useWalletConnectV1 } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithWalletConnect = useWalletConnectV1();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithWalletConnect({
          chainId: DogechainTestnet.chainId, // (568)
        })
      }
    >
      Connect wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

If the given Network is not configured in the user's wallet, the user will be prompted to Add that network to the wallet. To do this, you must add this network in ThirdwebProvider's [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shown below.

```jsx
import { DogechainTestnet } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[DogechainTestnet]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

:::info
It's not necessary to get the chain object from `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package.

You can also create a custom chain object as shown [here](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#custom-chains)
