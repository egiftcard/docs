Hook that prompts users to connect their [Cometh Connect](/wallet/cometh) wallet to your app.

```jsx
import { useComethConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

To be able to interact with Cometh Connect, you need to create an account and get an apiKey from [cometh dashboard](https://app.cometh.io/dashboard)

You also need to indicate the chain that you are working on. For now, Cometh Connect supports these [networks](https://docs.cometh.io/connect/cometh-connect/supported-networks)

## Usage

```jsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { useComethConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";


function App() {
  const connectWithCometh = useComethConnect();

   const options = {
      // Place your Cometh Connect API key here.
      apiKey: "API_KEY",
      chain: Polygon,
      //this parameter is optionnal (allows reconnection)
      walletAddress:"WALLET_ADDRESS"
    },

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithCometh(options)}>
      Connect
    </button>
  );
}
```
