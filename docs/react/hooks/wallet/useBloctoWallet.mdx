Hook that prompts users to connect their [Blocto](/wallet/blocto) wallet to your app.

```jsx
import { useBloctoWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

The [bloctoWallet](/react/react.blocto) also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

## Usage

Call the function returned by the `useBloctoWallet` hook to prompt the user to connect their Blocto wallet to your dApp.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address.

```jsx
import { useBloctoWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithBlocto = useBloctoWallet();

  return <button onClick={() => connectWithBlocto()}>Connect Blocto</button>;
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>chainId</summary>
  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

This will prompt the user to switch to the given network after they connect.

```jsx
connectWithBlocto({
  // highlight-start
  chainId: Polygon.chainId,
  // highlight-end
});
```

If the chain is not configured in the user&rsquo;s wallet,
you must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop:

```jsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]} clientId="your-client-id">
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

<details>
  <summary>appId (recommended) </summary>
  <div>

To get advanced features and support from Blocto, you can create an appId from [blocto dashboard](https://docs.blocto.app/blocto-sdk/register-app-id)

```javascript
connectWithBlocto({
  // highlight-start
  appId: "YOUR_BLOCTO_APP_ID",
  // highlight-end
});
```
