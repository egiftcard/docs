Hook for getting the current signer of the connected wallet, if one is available.

Useful if you want to instantiate an instance of the [ThirdwebSDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromsigner)
with the signer of the connected wallet
in the TypeScript SDK, or using other web3 libraries that require a signer such as [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/) with the React SDK.

```jsx
import { useSigner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const signer = useSigner();
```

## Usage

Returns the `Signer` of the connected wallet, if one is available.

If no wallet is connected, returns `undefined`.

```jsx
import { useSigner, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const signer = useSigner();
}
```

## Return Value
