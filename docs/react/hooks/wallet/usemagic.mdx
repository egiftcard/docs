Hook that prompts users to connect to your app using [Magic Auth](https://magic.link/docs/auth/overview) or [Magic Connect](https://magic.link/docs/connect/overview)

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

The [magicLink](/react/react.magicLink) also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

## Usage

calling this hook returns a `connect` function.

There are two ways to call this `connect` function: using `email` or `phoneNumber` if you are using `type: "auth"`

If you call the `connect` function with `email`, a modal will open and prompt the user to click on the link sent to their email. Once user completes this step, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.

If you call the connect method with `phoneNumber`, a modal will open and prompt the user to enter the OTP sent to their phone number. Once the user enters the OTP, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.

If you call the `connect` function with `type: "connect"`, a Magic Connect Widget will open and prompt the user to login with their email or Sign in with Google.

Once connected, you can use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address

Magic SDK requires an apiKey for instantiation. You can create a `apiKey` for your app on [magic.link](https://magic.link/)

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithMagic = useMagic();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const magicWallet = await connectWithMagic({
            type: "auth",
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            email: "user@example.com", // user's email
          });
        }}
      >
        connect with email
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const magicWallet = await connectWithMagic({
            type: "auth",
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            phoneNumber: "+123456789", // user's phone number
          });
        }}
      >
        connect with phone number
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const magicWallet = await connectWithMagic({
            type: "connect",
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          });
        }}
      >
        connect with magic connect Widget
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

```ts
chainId: number;
```

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithMagic = useMagic();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithMagic({
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          chainId: Polygon.chainId,
          email: "user@example.com",
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

You must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shown below

```jsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]} clientId="your-client-id">
      <App />
