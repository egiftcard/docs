Hook for checking whether the connected wallet is currently on the correct chain,
i.e. the chain specified in the [`activeChain`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#activechain) on the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Call the hook to get a boolean value indicating whether the connected wallet is on the correct chain.

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch();
};
```

Using this value, you can prompt users to switch their network using the [`useNetwork`](/react/react.useNetwork) hook.

## Return value

Returns `true` if the `chainId` of the connected wallet is different from the `chainId` of the [`activeChain`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#activechain) on the [`</ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).

```ts
boolean;
```
