Hook for reading events emitted by a smart contract, including new events as they are emitted (optional).

```jsx
import { useContractEvents } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractEvents(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your smart contract instance from [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook as the argument.

By default, reads all events emitted by the smart contract.

```jsx
import { useContractEvents, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractEvents(contract);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>eventName</summary>
  <div>

### eventName (optional)

The name of the event to query for. For example, if your smart contract emits an event called `MyEvent`, you would pass `"MyEvent"` to this parameter.

Omit this parameter or provide `undefined` to query for all events emitted by the smart contract.

```jsx
import { useContractEvents, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractEvents(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    "MyEvent", // Event name being emitted by your smart contract
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

  <div>

### options (optional)

An object containing options to filter the events being queried.

Available options include `queryFilter` to refine which events you want to read, and a boolean `subscribe` flag to subscribe to new events as they are emitted.

```jsx
import {
  useContractEvents,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractEvents(
    contract,
    "MyEvent",
    {
      // highlight-start
      queryFilter: {
        filters: {
          tokenId: 123, // e.g. Only events where tokenId = 123
        },
        fromBlock: 0, // Events starting from this block
        toBlock: 100, // Events up to this block
        order: "asc", // Order of events ("asc" or "desc")
      },
      subscribe: true, // Subscribe to new events
      // highlight-end
    },
  );
```

</div>
</details>
