Hook for getting all wallet addresses that have a role in a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement [Permission Controls](/contractkit/extension-contracts/permissions).

```jsx
import { useAllRoleMembers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your contract instance as the argument.

```jsx
import { useAllRoleMembers, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useAllRoleMembers(contract);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object, where the keys are the role names and the values are arrays of wallet addresses that have that role.

```ts
Record<"admin" | "transfer" | "minter" | "pauser" | "lister" | "asset" | "unwrap" | "factory" | (string & {}), string[]> | undefined
```

For example, if the contract has two roles, `admin` and `transfer`, and the `admin` role has two members, the `data` property will look like this:

```ts
{
  admin: ["0x1234", "0x5678"],
  transfer: [],
}
```
