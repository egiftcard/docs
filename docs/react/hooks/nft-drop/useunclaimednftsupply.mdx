Hook for fetching the number of unclaimed NFTs from an NFT/Edition Drop contract.

Unclaimed NFTs are tokens that were lazy-minted but have not yet been claimed by a user.

Available to use on contracts that implement the [LazyMint](/solidity/extensions/lazymint) extension;
such as the [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721) contract.

```jsx
import { useUnclaimedNFTSupply } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useUnclaimedNFTSupply(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your drop contract from the [`useContract`](react/hooks/usecontract) hook as the argument.

Returns the number of NFTs that are still unclaimed.

```jsx
import { useUnclaimedNFTSupply, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "nftDrop");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useUnclaimedNFTSupply(contract);
}
```
