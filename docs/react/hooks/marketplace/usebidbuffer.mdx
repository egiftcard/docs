import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Hook for determining the current bid buffer on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace)
or [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

The bid buffer is what percentage higher the next bid must be than the current highest bid, or the starting price if there are no bids.

```jsx
import { useBidBuffer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useBidBuffer(contract, listingId);
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract as the first argument, and the listing ID as the second argument.

```jsx
import { useBidBuffer, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// Listing ID to get the bid buffer for
const listingId = 1;

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    data: bidBuffer,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useBidBuffer(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The listing ID of the item that you want to get the bid buffer for.

The listing must be an auction (or english auction) listing, the hook will populate the `error` property if it is not.

```ts
import { useBidBuffer, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    data: bidBuffer,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useBidBuffer(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Return Value

<details>
  <summary>Return Value</summary>
  <div>

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, returns a `BigNumber` value representing the current bid buffer.

```ts
bidBuffer: BigNumber;
```

The `bidBuffer` value returned is in percentage format.
For example, a value of `500` means that the next bid must be 5% higher than the current highest bid.
