## Return Value

  <summary>Return Value</summary>
    <div>

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an array of listing objects.

The exact shape of each object depends on the type of listing.

For auctions, it will be a
`AuctionListing` object.
For direct listings, it will be a `DirectListing` object.

```ts
(AuctionListing | DirectListing)[] | undefined;
```

You can use the shared `type` property to determine which type of listing is being returned.

```ts
interface AuctionListing {
  /**
   * The id of the listing
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * The address of the asset being listed.
   */
  assetContractAddress: string;
  /**
   * The ID of the token to list.
   */
  tokenId: BigNumberish;
  /**
   * The asset being listed.
   */
  asset: NFTMetadata;
  /**
   * The start time of the listing.
   */
  startTimeInEpochSeconds: BigNumberish;
  /**
   * Number of seconds until the auction expires.
   */
  endTimeInEpochSeconds: BigNumberish;
  /**
   * The quantity of tokens to include in the listing.
   *
   * For ERC721s, this value should always be 1 (and will be forced internally regardless of what is passed here).
   */
  quantity: BigNumberish;
  /**
   * The address of the currency to accept for the listing.
   */
  currencyContractAddress: string;
  /**
   * The reserve price is the minimum price that a bid must be in order to be accepted.
   */
  reservePrice: BigNumber;
  /**

   * Useful for displaying the price information.
   */
