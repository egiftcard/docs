Hook for getting all of the offers made on a
direct listing on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contract.

```jsx
import { useOffers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data: offers, isLoading, error } = useOffers(contract, listingId);
```

## Usage

Provide your [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contract from the
[`useContract`](/react.usecontract) hook and the `listingId` of the listing you want to get the offers for as
arguments to the hook.

```jsx
import { useOffers, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing ID you want to fetch offers for
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data: offers, isLoading, error } = useOffers(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The ID of the listing to get the offers for.

If the listing cannot be found, is not a direct listing, or is not active, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useOffers, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing ID you want to fetch offers for
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    data: offers,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useOffers(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
