Hook for getting all of the offers made on a
direct listing on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contract.

```jsx
import { useOffers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contract from the
[`useContract`](/react.usecontract) hook and the `listingId` of the listing you want to get the offers for as
arguments to the hook.

```jsx
import { useOffers, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing ID you want to fetch offers for
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data: offers, isLoading, error } = useOffers(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

### listingId (required)

The ID of the listing to get the offers for.

If the listing cannot be found, is not a direct listing, or is not active, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useOffers, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing ID you want to fetch offers for
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    data: offers,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useOffers(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

## Return Value

This hook uses the [`useEvents`](/react.useevents) hook under the hood to fetch `NewOffer` events for the given listing ID.

The return value is an array of `NewOffer` event objects. Each event object has the following properties:

```ts
{
  offeror: string;
  offerId: BigNumber;
  assetContract: string;
  offer: {
    offerId: BigNumber;
    offeror: string;
    assetContract: string;
    tokenId: BigNumber;
    quantity: BigNumber;
    currency: string;
    totalPrice: BigNumber;
    expirationTimestamp: BigNumber;
    tokenType: "ERC721" | "ERC1155";
    status: "UNSET" | "CREATED" | "COMPLETED" | "CANCELLED";
  }
}
```
