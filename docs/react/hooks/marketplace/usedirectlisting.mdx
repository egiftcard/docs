Hook to get a specific direct listing from a [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

```jsx
import { useDirectListing } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useDirectListing(contract, listingId);
```

## Usage

To get a specific direct listing, provide your Marketplace V3 contract instance and the listing ID as
arguments to the hook.

```jsx
import { useDirectListing, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing id you want to check
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: directListing,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useDirectListing(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The ID of the listing to get.

If the listing is not found (or is not a direct listing), the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useDirectListing, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The listing id you want to check
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: directListing,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useDirectListing(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
