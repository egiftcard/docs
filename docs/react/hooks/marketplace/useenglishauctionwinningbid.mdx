Hook to get the winning bid for an English auction listing from a
[Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctionWinningBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useEnglishAuctionWinningBid(
  contract,
  listingId,
);
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace V3 contract instance and the listing ID as
arguments to the hook.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctionWinningBid, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The id of the auction listing you want to check
const listingId = "{{auction_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: winningBid,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuctionWinningBid(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The id of the auction listing you want to check.

If the listing cannot be found, or is not an English auction, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctionWinningBid, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The id of the auction listing you want to check
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{auction_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: winningBid,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuctionWinningBid(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Return Value

<details>
  <summary>Return Value</summary>
  <div>

If there are no bids, the `data` property will be `undefined`. Use the `isLoading` property to differentiate between
the loading state and the no bids state.

If there is a bid, the hook's `data` property, once loaded, will be an object of type `Bid`, containing the following properties:

```ts
{
  /**
   * The id of the auction.
   */
  auctionId: string;
  /**
   * The address of the buyer who made the offer.
   */
  bidderAddress: string;
  /**
   * The currency contract address of the offer token.
   */
  currencyContractAddress: string;
  /**
   * The amount of coins offered per token.
   */
  bidAmount: string;
  /**
   * The `CurrencyValue` of the listing. Useful for displaying the price information.
   */
  bidAmountCurrencyValue: {
    symbol: string;
    value: BigNumber;
    name: string;
    decimals: number;
    displayValue: string;
  }
}
```

</div>
