import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Hook for fetching all active listings from a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace)
contract.
"Active" means the listing is not canceled, expired, or sold.

```jsx
import { useActiveListings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveListings(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract as the argument to the hook.

The returned `data` contains both kinds of listings; auctions and direct.

```jsx
import { useActiveListings, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveListings(contract);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>filter (optional)</summary>
  <div>

By default, the hook returns all active listings from the marketplace.

You can filter the results by providing a `filter` object as the second argument.

```jsx
import { useActiveListings, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveListings(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    {
      seller: "{{wallet_address}}", // Filter by seller
      tokenContract: "{{contract_address}}", // Filter by token contract
      offeror: "{{wallet_address}}", // Filter by offeror
      tokenId: "{{token_id}}", // Filter by token ID
      count: 10, // Limit the number of results
      start: 0, // Start from the nth result (useful for pagination)
    },
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Return Value

`AuctionListing` and `DirectListing` objects.
