Hook to get an english auction listing from a [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuction } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useEnglishAuction(contract, listingId);
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace V3 contract instance and the listing ID as
arguments to the hook.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuction, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The auction id you want to check
const listingId = "{{auction_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: englishAuction,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuction(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

If the listing with this ID cannot be found (or is not an auction), the `error` property will be set.

import { useEnglishAuction, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// The auction id you want to check
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: englishAuction,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuction(contract, listingId);
}
