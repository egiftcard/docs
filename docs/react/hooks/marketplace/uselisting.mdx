The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object containing the desired listing data.

The exact shape of the object depends on the type of listing.

For auctions, it will be a
`AuctionListing` object.
For direct listings, it will be a `DirectListing` object.

```jsx
AuctionListing | DirectListing | undefined;
```

You can use the shared `type` property to determine which type of listing is being returned.

```ts
interface AuctionListing {
  /**
   * The id of the listing
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * The address of the asset being listed.
