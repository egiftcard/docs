Hook for placing a bid on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) auction listing.

Bids have several important properties:

- Cannot be canceled once placed.
- Are automatically refunded if they are outbid.
- Must be higher than the current highest bid by the percentage defined in the bid buffer.
- Must be higher than the reserve price (if there is no bid yet).

```jsx
import { useMakeBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { mutateAsync: makeBid, isLoading, error } = useMakeBid(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract instance from the [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook as the argument.

Then, provide the `listingId` and `bid` value to the mutation.

```jsx
import { useMakeBid, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { mutateAsync: makeBid, isLoading, error } = useMakeBid(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        makeBid({
          listingId: "1", // ID of the listing to bid on. Must be an auction.
          bid: "1", // Uses the currencyContractAddress of the listing.
        })
      }
    >
      Make Bid
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The ID of the listing to bid on. Must be an auction type listing.
(Use [`useMakeOffer`](/react/react.usemakeoffer) for direct listings).

If the listing cannot be found, is not an auction, or is not active, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useMakeBid, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { mutateAsync: makeBid, isLoading, error } = useMakeBid(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        makeBid({
          // highlight-next-line
          listingId: listingId, // ID of the listing to bid on. Must be an auction.
          bid: "1", // Uses the currencyContractAddress of the listing.
        })
      }
    >
      Make Bid
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>bid (required)</summary>
  <div>

### bid (required)

The amount to bid on the listing. Uses the `currencyContractAddress` of the listing.

For example, if the listing uses the `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` on Ethereum, the bid amount is the amount of ETH to bid. Can be
in the form of a number, string, or BigNumber.

The bid value **must** be either:

- Greater than or equal to the reserve price if there is no current bid.
- Greater than the current highest bid by the percentage defined in the bid buffer.

Use the [`useNextMinimumBid`](/react/react.usenextminimumbid) hook to get the next minimum bid amount required.

```jsx
import { useMakeBid, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// What value to place in the bid
// highlight-next-line
const amountToBid = "{{amount_to_bid}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { mutateAsync: makeBid, isLoading, error } = useMakeBid(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        makeBid({
          listingId: 0, // ID of the listing to bid on. Must be an auction.
          // highlight-next-line
          bid: amountToBid, // Uses the currencyContractAddress of the listing
        })
      }
    >
      Make Bid
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
