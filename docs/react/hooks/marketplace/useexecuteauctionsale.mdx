Hook for executing a sale of an auction listing on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contract.

Triggers a new sale, transferring the NFT(s) to the buyer and the funds to the seller.

A sale must be executed when an auction ends, and the auction has a winning bid that was below the buyout price. This means the
auction has finished, and the highest bidder has won the auction. **Any wallet** can now execute the sale, transferring the NFT(s)
to the buyer and the funds to the seller.

```jsx
import { useExecuteAuctionSale } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { mutateAsync, isLoading, error } = useExecuteAuctionSale(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract as the argument to the hook.

Then, provide the `listingId` of the auction you want to execute the sale on to the mutation.

```jsx
import {
  useExecuteAuctionSale,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    mutateAsync: executeAuctionSale,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useExecuteAuctionSale(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        executeAuctionSale({
          // The listingId of the auction to execute
          listingId: "{{listing_id}}",
        })
      }
    >
      Execute Auction Sale
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId</summary>
  <div>

### listingId

The ID of the auction listing to execute the sale on.

If the listing cannot be found, is not an auction, or is not ready to be executed, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import {
  useExecuteAuctionSale,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    mutateAsync: executeAuctionSale,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useExecuteAuctionSale(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        executeAuctionSale({
          // The listingId of the auction to execute
          // highlight-next-line
          listingId: "{{listing_id}}",
        })
      }
    >
      Execute Auction Sale
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
