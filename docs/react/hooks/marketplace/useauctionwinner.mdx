Hook for getting the winner of an auction (or english auction) on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace)
or [MarketplaceV3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

```jsx
import { useAuctionWinner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract and the listing ID as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useAuctionWinner, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useAuctionWinner(
    contract,
    1, // The listing id of the item that you want to get the auction winner for
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### listingId (required)

The listing ID of the item that you want to get the auction winner for.

The listing must be an auction (or english auction) listing, the hook will populate the `error` property if it is not.

```ts
import { useAuctionWinner, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useAuctionWinner(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId, // The listing id of the item that you want to get the auction winner for
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains a string
representing the address of the auction winner, or undefined if there is no winner.

```ts
string | undefined;
```
