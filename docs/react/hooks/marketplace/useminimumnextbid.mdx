Hook for getting the minimum value a bid must be to be valid
in an auction listing on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) or
[MarketplaceV3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

Takes into account the current highest bid, or the reserve price if there is no bid,
and increments it by the bid buffer to calculate the minimum next bid.

```jsx
import { useMinimumNextBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useMinimumNextBid(contract, listingId);
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract and the listing ID you wish to check as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useContract, useMinimumNextBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useMinimumNextBid(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>listingId (required)</summary>
  <div>

### listingId (required)

The ID of the listing to get the minimum next bid for.

If the listing cannot be found, is not an auction listing, or is not active, the `error` property will be set.

```jsx
import { useContract, useMinimumNextBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// highlight-next-line
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useMinimumNextBid(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    listingId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Return Value
