Hook for getting a wallet's current balance of an ERC20 token, (including native tokens such as Ether).

```jsx
import { useBalance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide the token contract address as the argument.

```jsx
import { useBalance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your ERC20 token smart contract address
const tokenAddress = "{{token_address}}";

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useBalance(tokenAddress);
}
```

To load the balance of the native token to the chain, such as Ether on Ethereum, import the `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` constant from `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`.

```jsx
import { useBalance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useBalance(NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```ts
{
  symbol: string;
  value: BigNumber;
  name: string;
  decimals: number;
  displayValue: string;
} | undefined>;
```
