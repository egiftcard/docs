This hook is similar to the [useBalance](/react/react.usebalance) hook, however it takes in a mandatory `walletAddress` parameter.
This hook only fetches the native token balance of the given address and does not work with ERC20 tokens. If you want to get the ERC20 balance from a given wallet, use [useTokenBalance](/react/react.usetokenbalance)

```jsx
import { useBalanceForAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide the wallet address as the argument.

```jsx
import { useBalanceForAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// The EVM wallet address that you want to fetch info from
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useBalanceForAddress(walletAddress);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```ts
{
  symbol: string;
  value: BigNumber;
  name: string;
  decimals: number;
  displayValue: string;
} | undefined>;
```
