## Web3Button variable

> This feature is currently in beta and may change based on feedback that we receive.

A component that allows the user to call an on-chain function on a contract.

The button has to be wrapped in a `ThirdwebProvider` in order to function.

## Example

```javascript
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Web3Button contractAddress="0x..." functionName="mint" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
Web3Button: <TExecutableFn extends ExecutableFn>({
  contractAddress,
  overrides,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  onSubmit,
  isDisabled,
  children,
  functionName,
  params,
  callable,
  ...themeProps
}: PropsWithChildren<Web3ButtonProps<TExecutableFn>>) => JSX.Element;
```
