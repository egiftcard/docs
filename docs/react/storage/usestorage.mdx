Get the instance of the `ThirdwebStorage` class being used by the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).

Allows you to use the TypeScript SDK functionality of [Storage](/storage) in your React app.

## API Key

You will require an API key to use thirdweb’s storage services with the SDK. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

You can then obtain a `clientId` from the API key which you will need to pass to the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID">
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Configurable in the [`storageInterface`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#storageinterface-optional) prop of the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).

The hook returns a [`ThirdwebStorage`](/typescript/storage) instance. View the [TypeScript Storage](/typescript/storage) documentation for more information.

```jsx
import { useStorage } from "@thirdweb/react";
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useStorage } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Component() {
  const storage = useStorage();

  // Now you can use the functionality of the ThirdwebStorage class:
  storage?.download(); // Download a file from IPFS
  storage?.upload(); // Upload a file to IPFS
}
```
