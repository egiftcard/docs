# useAddress

Hook for accessing the address of the connected wallet

```javascript
import { useAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Example

To get the address of the connected wallet, you can use the hook as follows:

```javascript
import { useAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  const address = useAddress();

  return <div>{address}</div>;
};
```

The `address` variable will hold the address of the connected wallet if a user has connected using one of the supported wallet connection hooks.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function useAddress(): string | undefined;
```

**Returns:**

string \| undefined
