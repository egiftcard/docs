<h1 align="center">thirdweb React SDK</h1>

A collection of 100+ React hooks and UI components for your web3 apps, for <i>any</i> EVM-compatible blockchain.

Connect to user&rsquo;s wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign
messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, marketplaces; all with built-in caching, RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

## How It Works

The React SDK uses [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview) under the hood to
expose a collection of [query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries) and [mutation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations)
hooks, each with built-in [caching](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/caching),
[query invalidation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/query-invalidation), [query retries](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/query-retries),
and more.

Each hook _(except for wallet/network management)_ wraps some functionality of the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript),
which are made available as either a [query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries) hook to read data,
or as a [mutation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations) hook to write transactions to the blockchain.

When mutations are called (when a user executes a transaction), [query invalidation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/query-invalidation) is automatically triggered
to update the relevant queries that depend on the data that was changed. For example, when minting a new NFT, queries that view information about
NFTs are re-fetched to load the new NFT automatically.

### Queries

All query hooks are used to **read** data from the blockchain, smart contracts, a user&rsquo;s wallet, etc.

Each one comes with some helpful properties to create a powerful user experience:

- `data` - The data returned from the query (e.g. the NFTs of a contract).
- `isLoading` - Whether the query is currently loading.
- `error` - The error returned from the query, if any.

```tsx
import { useContractRead, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { data: contract } = useContract("{{contract_address}}");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractRead(contract, "functionName");
}
```

### Mutations

Mutations are used to **write** data to the blockchain when a transaction is required.

They require a wallet to be connected, and by default, are executed from the currently connected wallet.

Each mutation comes with similar properties to queries:

- `mutate` - The function to execute the mutation (e.g. mint a new NFT).
- `mutateAsync` - The function to execute the mutation, but returns a promise (allowing `await` to be used).
- `isLoading` - Whether the mutation is currently executing.
- `error` - The error returned from the mutation, if any.

```tsx
import { useContractWrite, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { data: contract } = useContract("{{contract_address}}");
  const { mutateAsync, isLoading, error } = useContractWrite(
    contract,
    "functionName",
  );
}
```

Upon execution of a mutation, the relevant queries are automatically invalidated to fetch the latest data.
