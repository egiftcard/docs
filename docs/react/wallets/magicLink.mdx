## Usage with `ConnectWallet`

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[
    magicLink({
      apiKey: "MAGIC_API_KEY",
    }),
  ]}
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with `useConnect`

you can use the `useConnect` hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component.

Connecting wallet with `useConnect` **does not** require adding wallet to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop

Calling `connect` opens the Magic's Modal and prompts the user to either enter an OTP sent to their phoneNumber or click on the link sent to their email.

There are two ways to call this conect function: using `email` or `phoneNumber`

```tsx
const magicLinkConfig = magicLink({
  apiKey: "MAGIC_API_KEY",
});

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    await connect(magicLinkConfig, connectOptions);
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

### connectOptions

```ts
{
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  chainId?: number;
}
```

<details>
  <summary>chainId (optional) </summary>
<div>

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected and immediately switch to network with given `chainId`.

`Chain` object corresponding to this chainId from [@thirdweb-dev/chains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/chains) package must be specified in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedchains-optional) prop as shown below

```tsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>email or phoneNumber </summary>
  <div>

specify either `email` or `phoneNumber` of the user to connect to your app.

If you call the `connect` function with `email`, a modal will open and prompt the user to click on the link sent to their email. Once user completes this step, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.

If you call the connect method with `phoneNumber`, a modal will open and prompt the user to enter the OTP sent to their phone number. Once the user enters the OTP, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.
