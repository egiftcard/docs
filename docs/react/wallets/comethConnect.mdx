A wallet configurator for [MetaMask](/wallet/metamask) which allows integrating the wallet with React

To be able to interact with Cometh Connect, you need to create an account and get an apiKey from [cometh dashboard](https://app.cometh.io/dashboard)

You also need to indicate the chain that you are working on. For now, Cometh Connect supports these [networks](https://docs.cometh.io/connect/cometh-connect/supported-networks)

```tsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ComethConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const options = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  chain: Polygon,
};
const wallet = new ComethConnect(options);

wallet.connect();
```

<CustomizeWalletConfigurator
  config="bloctoWalletConfig"
  configurator="bloctoWallet"
  connectUI="BloctoWalletConnectUI"
  selectUI="BloctoWalletSelectUI"
  isInstalled="isBloctoWalletInstalled"
/>

### options

<details>
  <summary>clientId (recommended) </summary>
  <div>

Provide `clientId` to use the thirdweb RPCs for given `chains`

You can create a client ID for your application from [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

```javascript
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ComethConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const options = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  chain: Polygon,
};
const wallet = new ComethConnect(
  {
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  },
  options,
);
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>walletAddress</summary>
  <div>

Connect to an existing Cometh Connect smart wallet

This parameter allow you to connect to a user that already created a Cometh Connect smart wallet, see our [`docs`](https://docs.cometh.io/connect/cometh-connect/create-a-wallet#connect-to-an-existing-wallet) for more info.

```javascript
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ComethConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const options = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  chain: Polygon,
  walletAddress: walletAddress,
};
const wallet = new ComethConnect(options);
```

</div>
</details>

## Usage with `Cometh Connect`

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

Wallet Address is optionnal in the option config.

```tsx
const options = {
  apiKey: "bef322c7-2612-4f91-ab1d-65c99c88c758",
  chain: Gnosis,
  walletAddress: walletAddress,
};

<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[comethConnect(options)]}
  clientId="your-client-id"
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

## Usage with `useConnect`

you can use the `useConnect` hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
const options = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  chain: Polygon,
  walletAddress: walletAddress,
};

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    await connect(comethConnect(options));
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```
