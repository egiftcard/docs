Implementation of the WalletConnect protocol. The `dAppMeta` prop passed in the `ThirdwebProvider` above will be used when connecting to the wallets to show your app's information.

```tsx
import { trustWallet, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import { Ethereum } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const App = () => {
  const activeChain = Ethereum;
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      clientId="your-client-id"
      activeChain={activeChain}
      supportedChains={[activeChain]}
      supportedWallets={[
        trustWallet({
          projectId: "your-wallet-connect-project-id", // optional but we recommend you get your own for production
        }),
      ]}
    >
      <AppInner />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

## options

<details>
  <summary>projectId</summary>
  <div>

The WalletConnect `projectId`. You can get one in the [WalletConnect portal](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in).

Defaults to a common `projectId` set by thirdweb. This should be ok for testing but note that if you want to deploy your mobile app it may make sense to create your own as WalletConnect may throttle traffic coming from the same `projectId`.

```ts
trustWallet({
  // highlight-start
  projectId: "wc-projectId",
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>recommended (optional) </summary>
  <div>

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the ConnectWallet Modal.

```ts
trustWallet({
  // highlight-start
  recommended: true,
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>
