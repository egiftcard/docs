A wallet configurator for [Coinbase Wallet](/wallet/coinbase-wallet) which allows integrating the wallet with React Native

```tsx
import { coinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const coinbaseConfig = coinbaseWallet(options);
```

<CustomizeWalletConfiguratorRN
  config="coinbaseConfig"
  configurator="coinbaseWallet"
  connectUI="CoinbaseConnectUI"
  selectUI="CoinbaseSelectUI"
/>

## options

<details>
  <summary> callbackURL </summary>
  <div>

The Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK uses Universal Links to communicate between Coinbase Wallet and your application.
We wrote [a short guide](/react-native/faq/deeplinks) to help you enable deep links support in your mobile app or
you can check the [Coinbase setup](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/ios-setup).

```ts
coinbaseWallet({
  // highlight-start
  callbackURL: new URL("your.scheme://"),
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>recommended (optional) </summary>
  <div>

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the ConnectWallet Modal.

```ts
coinbaseWallet({
  // highlight-start
  recommended: true,
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

## Setup

To configure the Coinbase Wallet you need to follow the steps outlined in their [Setup Guide](https://coinbase.github.io/wallet-mobile-sdk/docs/client-sdk/rn-setup). A few caveats before going through the guide:

1. For Android, you only need to declare the `<queries>` tag in the AndroidManifest.xml **if** [your app targets Android 11 (API level 30)](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility/declaring)
2. For iOS, you need to setup [UniversalLinks](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) to allow the wallet to communicate back to your app, otherwise the wallet will not redirect you back to the app. You can pass your app's UniversalLink when you create the Coinbase Wallet:

## Usage with `ConnectWallet`

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[coinbaseWallet()]}
  clientId="your-client-id"
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with `useConnect`

you can use the `useConnect` hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
const coinbaseConfig = coinbaseWallet();

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    await connect(coinbaseConfig, connectOptions);
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

### connectOptions

```ts
{ chainId?: number } | undefined
```

<details>
  <summary>chainId (optional) </summary>
<div>

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected and immediately switch to network with given `chainId`.

`Chain` object corresponding to this chainId from [@thirdweb-dev/chains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/chains) package must be specified in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedchains-optional) prop as shown below

```tsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]} clientId="your-client-id">
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
