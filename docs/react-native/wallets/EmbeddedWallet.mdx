A wallet configurator for [Embedded Wallet](/wallet/embedded-wallet) (email + Google Sign In) which allows integrating the wallet with React Native.

```tsx
import { embeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const embeddedWalletConfig = embeddedWallet();
```

<CustomizeWalletConfiguratorRN
  config="embeddedWalletConfig"
  configurator="embeddedWallet"
  connectUI="embeddedWalletConnectUI"
  selectUI="embeddedWalletSelectUI"
/>

Whether to show the Sign In with different providers.
Right now, only Google is supported.

To use this feature you will need to enable the `Embedded Wallets` service for your `clientId`
in your [Dashboard Settings](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings) and you will need to allowlist
your app's `redirectUrl` (more on this below).

`redirectUrl`: The `redirectUrl` must be a deeplink your app supports. This
is going to be used to redirect back from the browser after logging in with Google.

We wrote [a short guide](/react-native/faq/deeplinks) to help you enable deep links support in your mobile app.

```ts
embeddedWallet({
  // highlight-start
  oauthOptions: {
    providers: ["google"],
    redirectUrl: "your.scheme://",
  },
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Installation

To use the `embeddedWallet` you need to add the following dependencies to your project. Find the
command to add them all for convenience below.

yarn:

```yarn
yarn add amazon-cognito-identity-js@6.3.3 react-native-quick-base64 react-native-quick-crypto react-native-aes-gcm-crypto @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-inappbrowser-reborn@3.7.0
```

npm:

```npm
npm install amazon-cognito-identity-js@6.3.3 react-native-quick-base64 react-native-quick-crypto react-native-aes-gcm-crypto @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-inappbrowser-reborn@3.7.0
```

Here are the dependencies added:

- amazon-cognito-identity-js: "^6.3.3"
- react-native-quick-base64
- react-native-quick-crypto
- react-native-aes-gcm-crypto
  - This package requires minSdkVersion = 26 on Android
- @react-native-community/netinfo
- react-native-inappbrowser-reborn: "^3.7.0" (for Google Sign In)

  - There's an open issue on RN > 0.72: https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/issues/186 which you can [fix by](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/issues/186#issuecomment-1663666739) adding the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

    ```
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so'
    }
    ```

  - When building the iOS app in release mode for RN 0.71 you need to enable the OpenSSL framework in XCode. There are several solutions for this here:

## Usage with `ConnectWallet`

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  clientId="your-client-id"
  supportedWallets={[embeddedWallet()]}
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with `useEmbeddedWallet`

you can use the `useEmbeddedWallet` hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

The hook will return all the necessary functions you'll need to authenticate and connect to the embedded wallet.

**Connecting with Google sign in:**

```tsx
function App() {
  const { connect } = useEmbeddedWallet();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    await connect({
      strategy: "google",
    });
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

**Connecting with email verification:**

```tsx
function App() {
  const { connect, sendVerificationEmail } = useEmbeddedWallet();

  const preLogin = async (email: string) => {
    // send email verification code
    await sendVerificationEmail({ email });
  };

  const handleLogin = async (email: string, verificationCode: string) => {
    // verify email and connect
    await connect({
      strategy: "email_verification",
      email,
      verificationCode,
    });
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

### Available conenction strategies

```ts
// email verification
type EmailVerificationAuthParams = {
  strategy: "email_verification";
  email: string;
  verificationCode: string;
  recoveryCode?: string;
};

// google sign-in
type GoogleAuthParams = {
  strategy: "google";
  openedWindow?: Window;
  closeOpenedWindow?: (window: Window) => void;
};

// bring your own authentication
type JwtAuthParams = {
  strategy: "jwt";
  jwt: string;
  encryptionKey?: string;
};
```

<details>
  <summary>chainId (optional)</summary>
<div>

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected to network with given `chainId`, else wallet will be connected to the `activeChain` by default.
