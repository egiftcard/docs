Button to connect a user&rsquo;s wallet to your app, with support for
MetaMask,
Coinbase,
Rainbow,
TrustWallet and will add all other WalletConnect wallets.

Wallets you provide to the `ThirdwebProvider`'s `supportedWallets` prop are shown as options
to connect to (if not configured, the default options are shown: MetaMask and CoinbaseWallet).

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
```

## Usage

Render the `ConnectWallet` component to display the button.

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

function App() {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```

## Configuration

### theme

You can pass a custom `theme` object that will control the colors of the button
or pass one of our default themes: `light` or `dark`.

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

function App() {
  return <ConnectWallet theme="light" />;
}
```
