Hook for signing out of a wallet after a user has [logged in](/react-native/react-native.uselogin) using [auth](/auth).

```jsx
import { useLogout } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
```

## Usage

Call the `logout` function to have the user sign out.

The `isLoading` boolean can be used to display a loading state on the UI while the user is signing out.

```jsx
import { useLogout } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

function App() {
  const { logout, isLoading } = useLogout();

  return (
    <Button 
      title={isLoading ? "Logging out..." : "Logout"}
      onPress={() => logout()}/>
  );
}
```
