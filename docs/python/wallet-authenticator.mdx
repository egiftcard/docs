This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

The wallet authenticator enables server-side applications to securely identify the
**connected wallet address** of users on the client-side, and also enables users to authenticate
to any backend using just their wallet. It implements the JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
standard.

```python
# We specify the domain of the application to authenticate to
domain = "example.com"

# We can then generate a payload for the connected wallet to login
# This can also be done on the client side with the thirdweb TypeScript SDK
payload = sdk.auth.login(domain)

# Then, on the server, we can securely verify the connected address that signed the payload
address = sdk.auth.verify(domain, payload)

# And we can also generate an authentication token to send back to the original payload sender
token = sdk.auth.generate_auth_token(domain, payload)

# Finally, the token can be use dby the original payload sender to authenticate to the backend
# And the server can use the following function to authenticate the token and verify the address
address = sdk.auth.authenticate(domain, token)
```

## login

A client-side function that allows the **connected wallet** to login to a **server-side** application.

Generates a login payload that can be sent to the server-side for verification or authentication.

```python
# Add the domain of the application that you want to log in to
domain = "example.com"

# Generate a signed login payload for the connected wallet to authenticate with
payload = sdk.auth.login(domain)
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>
<div>

#### domain

The domain of the application that you want to log in to. Must be of type `str`.

#### options (optional)

The configuration options for the login payload. Must be a `LoginOptions` object:

```python
class LoginOptions:
    nonce: Optional[str] = None
    expiration_time: Optional[datetime] = None
    chain_id: Optional[int] = None
```

### Return Value

A `LoginPayload` object that can be sent to the server-side for verification or authentication. 

```python
class LoginPayload:
    payload: LoginPayloadData
    signature: str

class LoginPayloadData:
    domain: str
    address: str
    nonce: str
    expiration_time: datetime
    chain_id: Optional[int] = None
```

</div>
</details>

## verify

Server-side function to securely verify the address of the **logged in client-side wallet**

by validating the provided client-side login request.

```python
domain = "example.com"
payload = sdk.auth.login(domain)

# Verify the login request
address = sdk.auth.verify(domain, payload)
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>
<div>

#### domain

The domain of the application to verify the login request for. Must of of type `str`

#### payload

The login payload to verify. Must be a `LoginPayload` object

```python
class LoginPayload:
    payload: LoginPayloadData
    signature: str

class LoginPayloadData:
    domain: str
    address: str
    nonce: str
    expiration_time: datetime
    chain_id: Optional[int] = None
```

### Return Value

Returns the address of the logged in wallet that signed the payload as a `str` type.

</div>
</details>

## generate_auth_token

Server-side function that generates a JWT token from the provided login request that the

client-side wallet can use to authenticate to the server-side application.

```python
domain = "example.com"
payload = sdk.auth.login(domain)

# Generate an authentication token for the logged in wallet
token = sdk.auth.generate_auth_token(domain, payload)
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>
<div>

#### domain

The domain of the application to authenticate to. Must be of type `str`.

#### payload

The login payload to authenticate with. Must be a `LoginPayload` object:

```python
class LoginPayload:
    payload: LoginPayloadData
    signature: str

class LoginPayloadData:
    domain: str
    address: str
    nonce: str
    expiration_time: datetime
    chain_id: Optional[int] = None
```

#### options (optional)

The configuration options for the authentication token. Must be an `AuthenticationOptions` object:

```python
class AuthenticationOptions:
    invalid_before: Optional[datetime] = None
    expiration_time: Optional[datetime] = None
```

### Return Value 

Returns an authentication token `string` that can be used to make authenticated requests to the server.

</div>
</details>

## authenticate

Server-side function that authenticates the provided JWT token. This function verifies that

the provided authentication token is valid and returns the address of the authenticated wallet.

```python
domain = "example.com"
payload = sdk.auth.login(domain)
token = sdk.auth.generate_auth_token(domain, payload)

# Authenticate the token and get the address of the authenticating wallet
address = sdk.auth.authenticate(domain, token)
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>
<div>

#### domain

The domain of the application to authenticate the token to. Must be of type `str`.

#### token

The authentication token to authenticate with. Must be of type `str`.

### Return Value

A `string` representing the address of the authenticated wallet.
