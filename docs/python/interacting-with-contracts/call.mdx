If the functionality of your smart contract does not come under one of the [extension interfaces](/typescript/extensions#extensions),
use the generic `call` method to retrieve the data and store the value.

## Usage 

```python
# The first argument is the function name, any subsequent arguments are passed to the function
contract.call("function_name")
```

## Configuration

### function_name

The name of the function, view, mapping, variable, etc. on your smart contract.

Must be a `string`.

### args

The arguments to the function/variable, in the same order as the function signature on your smart contract.

If you provide too few or too many arguments, the function will throw an error.

```python
data = contract.call("function_name", "arg1", "arg2")
```

## Example

If I want to mint an NFT on my custom contract, I would want to use the `mintTo(address, uri)` function:

```python
address = "0x..."
uri = "ipfs://..."
contract.call("mintTo", address, uri)
```
