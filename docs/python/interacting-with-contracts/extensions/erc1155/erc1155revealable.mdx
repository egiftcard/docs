# ERC1155Revealable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`ERC1155`](/solidity/extensions/erc1155) and
[`LazyMint`](/solidity/extensions/lazymint) interfaces and inherit the
[`ERC1155DelayedReveal`](/solidity/extensions/erc1155delayedreveal) contract.

Allows you to lazy-mint batches of NFTs that are encrypted until a later time,
and reveal them at any time using a password.
