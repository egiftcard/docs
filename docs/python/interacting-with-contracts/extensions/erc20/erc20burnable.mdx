# ERC20Burnable

Functionality available for contracts that inherit the
[`ERC20`](/solidity/extensions/erc20) and
[`ERC20Burnable`](/contracts/erc20burnable) extensions.

Allows you to burn tokens (take them out of circulation).

## burn

```python
# The amount of this token you want to burn

tx_result = contract.erc20.burn(amount)
```

  # highlight-next-line

)
```

</div>
</details>

## burn_from

Burn tokens held by a specified wallet (requires [`allowance`](/python/python.erc20#allowance_of)).

```python
# Address of the wallet sending the tokens
