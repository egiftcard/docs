Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`DropSinglePhase`](/solidity/extensions/dropsinglephase) extension.

Enables wallets to claim (mint) tokens from the contract under specific conditions.

## claim

Claim a specified number of tokens to the **connected wallet**.

```python
address = "0x7fDae677aA6f94Edff9872C4b91D26407709c790" # address of the wallet you want to claim the NFTs
quantity = 42.69 # how many tokens you want to claim

tx = contract.erc20.claim(address, quantity)
receipt = tx.receipt; # the transaction receipt
```
