# ERC20SignatureMintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`ERC20`](/solidity/extensions/erc20) and
[`ERC20SignatureMint`](/solidity/extensions/erc20signaturemint) extensions.

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting) of new tokens.

## generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of tokens.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20
mint_request = PayloadToSign20(
  to = "{{wallet_address}}",
  price = 0.5,
  currency_address = "{{currency_contract_address}}",
  primary_sale_address = "{{primary_sale_address}}",
  quantity = 100,
  mint_start_time = int(time() + 60 * 60 * 24),
  mint_end_time = int(time()) - 1800,
  uid = None)

good_payload = token.signature.generate(mint_request)
```

### mint_request

The `mint_request` object you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

It must be of type `PayloadToSign20`

```python
PayloadToSign20 = Signature20PayloadInput

class Signature20PayloadInput(BaseSignaturePayloadInput):
    quantity: Price = 0

class BaseSignaturePayloadInput:
    to: str
    price: Price = 0
    currency_address: str = NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS
    mint_start_time: int = int(time())
    mint_end_time: int = int(time()) + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000 * 1000
    uid: Optional[bytes] = None
    primary_sale_recipient: Optional[str] = ZERO_ADDRESS
```

The `quantity` and `to` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint. Defaults to `0`.

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = "{{wallet_address}}"))
```

#### to (required)

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to))
```

#### currency_address (optional)

The address of the currency to pay for minting the tokens (use the [`price`](#price-optional) field to specify the price).

Defaults to `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (the native currency of the network, e.g. Ether on Ethereum).

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
currency_address = "0x..."
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to,
  currentcy_address = currency_address))
```

#### price (optional)

If you want the user to pay for minting the tokens, you can specify the price **per token**.

Defaults to `0` (free minting).

Needs to be of type `float`.

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
price = 0.4
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to,
  price = price))
```

#### mint_start_time (optional)

The time from which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `time()` (now).

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
mint_start_time = int(time() + 5)
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to,
  mint_start_time = mint_start_time))
```

#### mint_end_time (optional)

The time until which the signature can be used to mint tokens.

Defaults to `int(time() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10),` (10 years from now).

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
mint_end_time = int(time() * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10)
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to,
  mint_end_time = mint_end_time))
```

#### primary_sale_recipient (optional)

If a `price` is specified, the funds will be sent to the `primarySaleRecipient` address.

Defaults to the `primary_sale_recipient` address of the contract.

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

quantity = 1
to = "0x..."
price = 0.4
primary_sale_recipient = "0x..."
signature = contract.erc20.signature.generate(PayloadToSign20(
  quantity = quantity,
  to = to,
  price = price,
  primary_sale_recipient = primary_sale_recipient))
```

## generate_batch

Generate multiple signatures at once (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```python
from thirdweb.types.contracts.signature import PayloadToSign20

tx = contract.erc20.signature.generate_batch([
  PayloadToSign20(
    quantity = 100, # (Required) The quantity of tokens to be minted
    to = "{{wallet_address}}", # (Required) Who will receive the tokens
    currency_address = "{{currency_contract_address}}", # (Optional) the currency to pay with
    price = 0.5, # (Optional) the price to pay for minting those tokens (in the currency above)
    mint_start_time = int(time()), # (Optional) can mint anytime from now
    mint_end_time = int(time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000), # (Optional) to 24h from now,
    primary_sale_recipient = "0x...", # (Optional) custom sale recipient for this token mint
  ),
  PayloadToSign20(
    quantity = 100, # (Required) The quantity of tokens to be minted
    to = "{{wallet_address}}", # (Required) Who will receive the tokens
    currency_address = "{{currency_contract_address}}", # (Optional) the currency to pay with
    price = 0.5, # (Optional) the price to pay for minting those tokens (in the currency above)
    mint_start_time = int(time()), # (Optional) can mint anytime from now
    mint_end_time = int(time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000), # (Optional) to 24h from now,
    primary_sale_recipient = "0x...", # (Optional) custom sale recipient for this token mint
  )
])
```

  <div>

#### signatures

An array of signatures to generate. See [`generate`](#generate) for details.

</div>
</details>

## mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```python
# Use the signed payload to mint the tokens
tx = contract.erc20.signature.mint(signature)
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature (required)

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

Must be of type `SignedPayload20`

```python
# Use the signed payload to mint the tokens
tx = contract.erc20.signature.mint(
  # highlight-next-line
  signature, # Signature generated by the `generate` function
)
```

</div>
</details>

## mint_batch

Use multiple signatures at once to mint tokens.

Each signature must be of type `SignedPayload20` and be privided in a `List`.

```python
tx = contract.erc20.signature.mint_batch([
  signature1, # Signature generated by the `generate` or `generateBatch` function
  signature2,
  signature3,
])
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signatures

A list of signatures to mint. Each signature must be of type `SignedPayload20`.

```python
class SignedPayload20:
    payload: Signature20PayloadInput
    signature: str

class Signature20PayloadInput(BaseSignaturePayloadInput):
    quantity: Price = 0

class BaseSignaturePayloadInput:
    to: str
    price: Price = 0
    currency_address: str = NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS
    mint_start_time: int = int(time())
    mint_end_time: int = int(time()) + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000 * 1000
    uid: Optional[bytes] = None
    primary_sale_recipient: Optional[str] = ZERO_ADDRESS
```

See [`mint`](#mint) for details.

</div>
</details>

## verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload,
and prove that it was valid and was generated by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint`/`mintBatch` functions will fail (even without this verification check),
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```python
is_valid = contract.erc20.signature.verify(
  signature, # A previously generated signature
)
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### signature

The signature to verify.

Must be of type `SignedPayload20`

See [`generate`](#generate) for details.
