Instantiate the [`ThirdwebSDK`](/python.thirdwebsdk) in read-write mode using a wallet&rsquo;s private key.

All transactions made with this instance of the SDK will be signed using the private key.

## Usage

Provide the private key and the [chain](#chain) you want to use.

```python
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK
from dotenv.main import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
private_key = os.environ['PRIVATE_KEY']

sdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_signer(private_key, "mumbai")
```

## Configuration

### private_key

The [private key](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#externally-owned-accounts-and-key-pairs)
of the wallet you want to use to initiate transactions with.

:::danger Sensitive Value

The private key grants custody over the funds associated with your account.

Losing or leaking your private key will result in the loss of your funds.

```python
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK

sdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_signer(
    # highlight-next-line
    "private_key", # DANGER: This is a sensitive value that should be stored securely.
    "mumbai"
)
```

### chain

The chain you want to use. See [configuring chain](/python/python.thirdwebsdk#provider)
