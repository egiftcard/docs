# Airdrop of NFTs

Owners of NFT collections can also opt to deliver their NFTâ€™s via an airdrop mechanism. With airdrop, users select tokens and lists of addresses and can perform the airdrop with a single call.

```js
// The token ID of the NFT you want to airdrop
const tokenId = "0";
// Array of objects of addresses and quantities to airdrop NFTs to
const addresses = [
  {
    address: "0x...",
    quantity: 2,
  },
  {
    address: "0x...",
    quantity: 3,
  },
];
await contract.airdrop(tokenId, addresses);
```
