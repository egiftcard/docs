# Deploying a Smart Contract

Once a smart contract template has been selected, the contract can be deployed directly to any EVM-compatible blockchain using the Contract SDK.

```js
const contractAddress = await sdk.deployer.deployNFTDrop({
  name: "My Drop",
  primary_sale_recipient: "your-address",
});
```
