# Selecting a Smart Contract

Via thirdweb’s Contract SDK applications can query thirdweb’s smart contract registry to get a categorized set of smart contract plugins and templates that can be selected to be used in their collection.

```jsx
// getting contracts from the multi chain registry
const contracts = sdk.multiChainRegistry.getContractList(); // available soon
const plugins = sdk.multiChainRegistry.getAllPlugins(); // available soon
```
