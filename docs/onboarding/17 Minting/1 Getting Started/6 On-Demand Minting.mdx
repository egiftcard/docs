# On-Demand Minting

In some cases, owners of NFT collections want to allow for just in time, [on-demand minting](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/advanced-features/on-demand-minting). Examples include:

- Allowing users to curate their own artwork to be minted
- Marking NFT metadata with user specific or off-chain information
- Deciding on a case by case basis whether a user can claim and what their claim conditions are

thirdweb provides a signature based minting mechanic which allows the publisher of the smart contract to issues signature vouchers that is sent back to the connected user giving them permission to mint ([design document](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/design/SignatureMint)).

Signature based minting allows for a very secure means of minting that prevents users from minting directly from the smart contract as only wallets designated with the MINTER role are allowed to issue signatures.

```js
// CLIENT: application sets nft metadata at run-time
const nftMetadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT #1",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
  image: fs.readFileSync("path/to/image.png"), // This can be an image url or file
};

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// SERVER: on back end signature is generated based on application rules
const startTime = new Date();
const endTime = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000);
const payload = {
  metadata: nftMetadata, // The NFT to mint
  to: {{wallet_address}}, // Who will receive the NFT
  quantity: 2, // the quantity of NFTs to mint
  price: 0.5, // the price per NFT
  currencyAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, // the currency to pay with
  mintStartTime: startTime, // can mint anytime from now
  mintEndTime: endTime, // to 24h from now
  royaltyRecipient: "0x...", // custom royalty recipient for this NFT
  royaltyBps: 100, // custom royalty fees for this NFT (in bps)
  primarySaleRecipient: "0x...", // custom sale recipient for this NFT
};

const signedPayload = await contract.erc721.signature.generate(payload);
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// CLIENT: mint using the signature
const tx = contract.erc721.signature.mint(signedPayload);
```
