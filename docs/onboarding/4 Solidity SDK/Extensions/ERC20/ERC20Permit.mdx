# ERC721Permit

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/interface/IERC20Permit.sol";
```

Implementing the `ERC20Permit` extensions allows approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
[EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612]).

The `permit` function can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
need to send a transaction and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.


:::info

This extension is an interface and requires all of the functions to be implemented

## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality. 

The [ERC721A](/solidity/extensions/erc721) contract comes with a `totalPermit`
function that returns the total number of NFTs that have been minted in the collection (including tokens that have been burned).

This means you can already view the total Permit of NFTs in the collection by implementing the `ERC721A` contract.

You can optionally override the functionality of this function as outlined below:

```solidity

contract Contract is ERC20, IERC20Permit {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC20(
            _name,
            _symbol
        )
    {}

    /**
     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,
     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction
     * ordering also apply here.
     *
     * Emits an {Approval} event.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.
     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`
     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.
     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).
     *
     * For more information on the signature format, see the
     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP

    function nonces(address owner) external view returns (uint256) {
        // Your custom implementation here
    }

    // solhint-disable-next-line func-name-mixedcase
