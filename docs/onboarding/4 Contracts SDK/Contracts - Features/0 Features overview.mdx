    <p>
        Features are individual pieces of functionality you can add to your smart contracts.
    </p>

Each feature you implement in your smart contract unlocks corresponding functionality for you to utilize in the SDK.

There are two kinds of features:

1. **Contracts**: Fully implemented features you can import and use.
2. **Interfaces**: Standards you must implement the required functionality to utilize.

We provide several features for adding functionality to your [ERC721](/extensions/erc721), [ERC1155](/extensions/erc1155), and
[ERC20](/extensions/erc20), as well as general extension for common use cases.

## Detecting Features

You can detect all of the features your contract implements using the CLI:

```bash
npx thirdweb detect
```
