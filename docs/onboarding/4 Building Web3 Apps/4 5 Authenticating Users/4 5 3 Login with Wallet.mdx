You can use the authentication SDK to allow users to login to your backend with just their connected wallet.

Typically, logging in means that you can do the following:

1. A user proves to the backend that they are in fact the identity they claim to have.
2. The backend will somehow register that they have logged in, and allow them to continue making requests as the logged in user.

Many applications accomplish the first step by making users enter their password into a form to prove that they are in fact the owner of their username, since only they will know the password. After this, a standard flow would be for the
backend to generate a  [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io) (which is just a string of characters that securely encodes data) and send it to the user. This token can then be attached to any future requests made by the user to prove that they are logged in.

You can accomplish this same flow with the authentication SDK with the following setup:
- First use the `login` method to sign a login request message that you can send to the backend. This is analagous to entering your password.
- Then on the backend, use the payload created by the `login` method to pass into the `generateAuthToken` method which you can then send to the user as a cookie for authentication.
- Finally, users who have the cookie will be able to make requests to the backend without needing to login again, and the backend can use the `authenticate` method to verify the authenticatd user on future requests.

Let's take a look at setting this all up.

### Making a Login Request

First, the user trying to authenticate to a backend needs to generate a login request to send to the backend. This method simply uses the wallet connected to the SDK to sign a login request message that specifies data about the user trying to login and some security specifications.

:::tip

In most cases, you'll want to use the JavaScript SDK for this if you want to allow users to login from a frontend application. However, for scripting or backend to backend use cases, you can also use the Python or Go SDKs.

### Generating a JSON Web Token

After generating a login payload on the client-side and sending it to the backend, the backend can then use that payload to verify the connected user and generate an authentication token for them with the following methods:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="generateAuthToken" />

This token contains data around how long the login request is valid for, the address of the user authenticating, and the backend that the token is intended for - all of which you can configure through the SDK with optional configuration (view the SDK documentation for more information on this).

:::warning

It's important that the generated JWT token is send back to the client-side as a **secure http-only cookie** to prevent it from being used in XSS attacks. You can see an example of how to do this in our [Basic Authentication Example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/sign-in-with-ethereum/blob/2ecbf412fdb9888a1f3027ba6ff737b735e8cfb3/pages/api/login.tsx#L37).

### Authenticating Requests

Once users have a JWT token, they can make requests to the backend without needing to login again. You can then use the `authenticate` method to verify the user is authenticated and to get their connected wallet address:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="authenticate" />
