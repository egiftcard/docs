The thirdweb Multiwrap contract lets you wrap [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20),
[ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and
[ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
tokens into a **single** wrapped ERC721 NFT.
The wrapped NFT can be unwrapped (burned) back into the underlying tokens.

The wrapped NFT itself also acts as an ERC-721 token, which can have the metadata you'd expect of an NFT,
such as a name, image, description, etc.

You could use the Multiwrap contract to:

- Combine multiple NFTs into one NFT with new metadata

- Wrap NFTs along with ERC-20 tokens to easily trade them for other NFTs

- Create a transparent "bundle" in your game, where the contents of the bundle are visible to the player

## Smart Contract Design

For a detailed exploration of how the multiwrap contract works, why it was built, and its technical details, visit our [Multiwrap Design Doc](/contracts/design/Multiwrap)!

## Create a Multiwrap Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployMultiwrap"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Multiwrap contract inside your application, you need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"Multiwrap"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs. For example, if you sell an NFT on the marketplace, and it is then sold again to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab, you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"royalties"} />

## Wrapping Tokens

You can wrap any number of ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens into a single wrapped ERC721 NFT.

When you wrap NFTs, you mint a new NFT into the Multiwrap contract.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"wrap"} />

## Viewing Wrapped NFTs

All of the wrapped NFTs are minted into the same collection.

### One wrapped NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"get"} />

### All wrapped NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"getAll"} />

### Amount of tokens owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## View Wrapped NFT Contents

The contents of a wrapped NFT are visible to everyone.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"getWrappedContents"} />

## Unwrapping Tokens

When you unwrap a wrapped NFT, you can get the underlying tokens back and **burn** the wrapped NFT.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"unwrap"} />

## Transferring NFTs

Transferring NFTs means you can send this NFT to another wallet. You must be the owner of the NFT you're trying to transfer for this to be successful.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Multiwrap"} name={"transfer"} />
