# Signature Drop

The Signature Drop contract uses the [ERC-721A](https://www.erc721a.org/) standard to
release a collection of one-of-one NFTs with lower gas fees for your community
compared to the regular ERC-721 standard used in the [NFT Drop](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop).

You **lazy-mint** your NFTs by uploading the metadata and configuring a claim phase, laying out the rules for how your users can claim
NFTs from your drop; such as an allowlist, release date, or [delayed reveal](/advanced-features/delayed-reveal).

The "signature" refers to thirdweb's [ERC-721S "Signature-Based Minting"](/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) feature,
that allows you to grant users the ability to mint NFT(s) based on a custom set of criteria, checked
on-demand.

You could use the Signature Drop contract to:

- Release a gas-optimized PFP Collection where each NFT has a different combination of traits

- Allow users that meet a certain criteria to be able to claim NFTs from your drop

## Create a Signature Drop Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"ContractDeployer"}
  name={"deploySignatureDrop"}
/>

<!-- ## Feature Sets -->
<!-- TODO: Explain how lazy minting works and what contract implementations are used on this contract here. -->

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Signature Drop contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"SignatureDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Lazy Minting Your NFTs

### Using the dashboard

You can batch upload NFTs through the dashboard by uploading a `.csv` file or a `.json` file that contains the metadata of all your NFTs, alongside the assets (images, videos, etc.).

- You must include a `name` column for each NFT in the `.csv` or `json` file
- Asset file names must be sequential. E.g. `0.png`, `1.png`, `2.png`.

You can use our examples to get started:

- [Example CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/example.csv)
- [Example JSON File](https://nightly.thirdweb.com/example.json)

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"createBatch"} />

## Setting Claim Phases

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can mint an NFT.

**The signature drop contract only supports one claim phase.**

Within a claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs do you want to drop
- How much do you want to charge per NFT
- What currency do you want to use
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"claimCondition"} />

## Delayed Reveals

Delayed reveal enables you to reveal the contents of the NFT to the user later at a specific date and show a placeholder asset in the meantime.

### Using the dashboard

- **Reveal upon mint**: Collectors will immediately see the final NFT when they complete the minting.
- **Delayed Reveal**: Collectors will mint your placeholder image, then you reveal it at a later time.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"revealer"} />

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs. For example, if somebody mints an NFT from your drop and then sells it to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab, you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"royalties"} />

## Minting / Claiming NFTs

In the signature drop contract, users claim NFTs by minting them into their wallets.
Typically you will have a "mint" button that your users can click, which mints this user the next unclaimed NFT in your collection.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"claimTo"} />

## Signature Minting

[Learn more about ERC-721S "Signature-Based Minting"](/advanced-features/on-demand-minting).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"signature"} />

## Viewing NFTs

Our SDKs provide helpful ways to view the NFTs in your collection.

### One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"get"} />

### All NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"getAll"} />

### Claimed NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"getAllClaimed"} />

### Unclaimed NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"getAllUnclaimed"} />

### NFTs owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Balance of a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Viewing Supply

### Claimed supply

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"totalClaimedSupply"} />

### Unclaimed supply

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"totalUnclaimedSupply"} />

## Transferring NFTs

You can transfer NFTs from one wallet to another.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"SignatureDrop"} name={"transfer"} />

## Burning NFTs

Burning is the process of removing the token from circulation by sending it to an inaccessible address. It does **not** delete the token from the blockchain.

### Using the dashboard

### Using the SDK
