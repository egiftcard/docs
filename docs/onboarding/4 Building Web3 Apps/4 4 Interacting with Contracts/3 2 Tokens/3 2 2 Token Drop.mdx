thirdweb's Token Drop contract is a way of releasing your [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) tokens for a set price.

The Token Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can claim your tokens;
including allowlists, release dates, and claim limits.

In the Token Drop, you define the price for your tokens in each claim phase and can set a limit on how many tokens you want to release.

You could use the Token Drop contract to:

- Release your new cryptocurrency for a set price such as 1 MATIC per token.
- Allow a specific set of wallets to claim your ERC-20 tokens before releasing them to the public.
- Allow users to claim your tokens up until a specific date.

## Smart Contract Design

For a detailed exploration of how our drop smart contracts work, why they were built, and their limitations, visit our [Drop Design Doc](/contracts/design/Drop)!

## Create a Token Drop Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployTokenDrop"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Token Drop contract inside your application, you need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"TokenDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Setting Claim Phases

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can mint your tokens.

You can have multiple claim phases that occur in sequence.

For each claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many tokens do you want to drop
- How much do you want to charge per token
- What currency do you want to charge in
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to claim tokens (allowlist)
- How many tokens can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims

### Using the dashboard

You can configure the claim phases from the dashboard's **Claim Phases** tab.

![Token Drop Claim Phases via Dashboard](../assets/token-drop-claim-phases.png)

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"claimConditions"} />

## Claiming Tokens

Your users can claim tokens if their wallet address meets the criteria included in the current claim phase.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"claimTo"} />

## Token Metadata

Get the metadata about the token itself, such as the name, symbol, and decimals.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"get"} />

You can get the total supply of the token too.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"totalSupply"} />

## Token Balance

### Balance of the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"balance"} />

### Balance of a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Token Allowance

Allowance refers to how many tokens another address is allowed to spend from your wallet.

For example, our [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) contract asks you permission to **increase your allowance** when you make a bid on an auction listing.

### Get allowance for the connected wallet

Get the number of tokens that another wallet can spend on behalf of the connected wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"allowance"} />

### Get allowance for a specified wallet

Get the number of tokens that another wallet can spend on behalf of the specified wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"allowanceOf"} />

### Set Allowance

Specify how many tokens another wallet is allowed to spend on behalf of the connected wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"setAllowance"} />

## Transfer Tokens

You can transfer tokens from one wallet to another or send tokens to a smart contract address.

### Transfer from the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"transfer"} />

### Transfer from the connected wallet in batch

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"transferBatch"} />

### Transfer from a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"transferFrom"} />

## Burning Tokens

Burning tokens takes a specified amount of tokens out of the circulating supply.

### Burn from the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"burn"} />

### Burn from a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"burnFrom"} />
