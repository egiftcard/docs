The Token contract is suited for projects in which you want to create your currency. This currency can be purchased and traded between users on an exchange, utilized to buy and sell NFTs in a marketplace, etc.

The Token contract is compliant with the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.

You could use the Token contract to:

- Create your cryptocurrency
- Sell your NFTs on the [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) in your custom token
- Reward users with tokens for some action they take

## Create a Token Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/setting-up).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployToken"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Token contract inside your application, you need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"Token"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Minting Tokens

### Using the dashboard

You can mint new tokens on the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) by clicking the **Mint** button.

### Using the SDK

#### Mint tokens to a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"mintTo"} />

#### Mint tokens to many wallets in one transaction (batch)

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"mintBatchTo"} />

## Token Metadata

Get the metadata about the token itself, such as the name, symbol, and decimals.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"get"} />

You can get the total supply of the token too.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"TokenDrop"} name={"totalSupply"} />

## Token Balance

### Balance of the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"balance"} />

### Balance of a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Token Allowance

Allowance refers to how many tokens another address is allowed to spend from your wallet.

For example, our [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) contract asks you permission to **increase your allowance** when you make a bid on an auction listing.

### Get allowance for the connected wallet

Get the number of tokens that another wallet can spend on behalf of the connected wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"allowance"} />

### Get allowance for a specified wallet

Get the number of tokens that another wallet can spend on behalf of the specified wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"allowanceOf"} />

### Set Allowance

Specify how many tokens another wallet is allowed to spend on behalf of the connected wallet.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"setAllowance"} />

## Transfer Tokens

You can transfer tokens from one wallet to another or send tokens to a smart contract address.

### Transfer from the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"transfer"} />

### Transfer from the connected wallet in batch

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"transferBatch"} />

### Transfer from a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"transferFrom"} />

## Burning Tokens

Burning tokens takes a specified amount of tokens out of the circulating supply.

### Burn from the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"burn"} />

### Burn from a specified wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"burnFrom"} />
