# Connecting to a Wallet

The SDK offers functions that allow you to let users connect their wallet to your app, and view information about their wallet such as their wallet address and token balance.

:::info Wallet Connection

These features are only available in our [React](/react) SDK.

If you are looking to connect to the SDK via your private key or via a signer object, use the [Backend & Scripting Applications](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk/backend) page.
