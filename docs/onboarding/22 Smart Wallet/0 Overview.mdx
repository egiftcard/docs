Everything you need to build [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Smart Wallets for your users.
Let your users connect to any [Smart Wallet](/glossary/smart-wallet).

A Smart Wallet is a wallet that is controlled by a smart contract following the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

thirdweb’s smart wallets have the following features by default:

- Have multiple owners
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

## Requirements

#### 1. Smart Wallet Factory Contract

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or use your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract.

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

|                    | [`Account`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) setup                                                                                     | [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) setup                                                                                                           | [`ManagedAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account) setup                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Upgradeability** | Non-upgradeable                                                                                                                         | Account upgrades controlled locally by account admin.                                                                                                                        | Account upgrades controlled centrally by account factory admin.                                                                                                                               |
| **User persona**   | Developer wants to issue simple smart wallets to their users. They do not anticipate that users wallets will need any feature upgrades. | Developer wants to issue smart wallets to their users. They do anticipate feature upgrades to user wallets but do not want to push upgrades to user wallets without consent. | Developer wants to issue smart wallets to their users. They do anticipate feature upgrades to user wallets, and want to push upgrades to user wallets for seamless/invisible UX for upgrades. |

#### 2. An API key

:::info
You will require an API key to use thirdweb’s infrastructure services such as the bundler and paymaster.

The API key will need to have the following settings:

- smart wallet as an enabled service
- The contracts that the smart wallet will interact with must be added to the "Destination Contracts" list. Learn more [here](/api-keys#smart-wallet-allowed-destination-addresses)

:::

Obtain an API key from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

The API key lets you access thirdweb's bundler and paymaster infrastructure, which is required for the smart wallet to operate and optionally enable [gasless transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions).

Learn more about creating an API key and restricting which contracts the smart wallet can interact with [here](/api-keys).

## Features

Smart Wallets are controlled by a programmable smart contract rather than by a user as is the case for externally-owned accounts (EOA). This programmable wallet contract can:

- Hold any assets
- Pay for its own gas
- Execute transactions in batches
- Have multiple owners
- Assign roles and permissions

And more!

Smart Wallets can be customized to each application's needs using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity).

The SmartWallet API is **composable** - you can use in your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract and you can also use your own bundler or paymaster services.

## Bundler & Paymaster Services

Thirdweb's bundler and paymaster services are used to fund and send transactions. To use these services, you need to setup a billing account on the thirdweb dashboard Settings page.

Smart Wallet is free to use with your own account abstraction infrastructure. To use your own paymaster & bundler,
pass the `bundlerUrl`, `paymasterUrl` and `paymasterAPI` options to the `SmartWallet`:

```javascript
class MyPaymaster extends PaymasterAPI {
  async getPaymasterAndData(
    userOp: Partial<UserOperationStruct>,
  ): Promise<string> {
    // your implementation, must return the signed paymaster data
  }
}

const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain,
  gasless,
  factoryAddress,
  clientId,
  bundlerUrl: "your-bundler-url",
  paymasterUrl: "your-paymaster-url",
  paymasterAPI: new MyPaymaster(),
};
```
