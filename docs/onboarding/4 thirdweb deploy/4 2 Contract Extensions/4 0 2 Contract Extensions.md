# How To Unlock SDK and Dashboard Features

The magic of the thirdweb deploy toolset is that you can implement specific features in your contracts to unlock full support for those features in the SDKs and the thirdweb Dashboard.

By implementing features from our [Contracts SDK](https://docs.thirdweb.com/contracts), we automatically give you full SDKs to support your contracts as well as custom-made interfaces to interact with your contracts in the dashboard.

You can check out each specific interface page to see how to implement the interfaces in your contracts and to learn what features you get for implementing these interfaces.
