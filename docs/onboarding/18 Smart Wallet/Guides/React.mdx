# Using Smart Wallet in React

By using the [wallet SDK](/wallet/smart-wallet) alongside the [React SDK](/react), you can use smart wallets in your front-end applications easily.

In react, there are three ways to get started with smart wallets:

- **Option 1** - Using the [`ConnectWallet`](#using-connectwallet) component - an out-of-the-box UI to connect your users with any wallet including smart wallet. This uses the Wallet SDK under the hood.
- **Option 2** - Using the [`useConnect` hook](#using-useconnect) to connect users and create a custom UI.
- **Option 3** - Using the [`Wallet SDK`](#using-thirdwebsdkprovider) directly for level control and full customization of the connection logic.

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/smart-accounts).

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 12, padding: 8, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Managed Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Dynamic Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DynamicAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## 2. Create an API key

To use the smart wallet bundler and paymaster, you must create an API key and a billing account.

To create an API Key:

- Head to the settings page in the dashboard and click the **API Keys** tab.
- Click on **Create API Key**:

![Create API Key](/assets/dashboard/settings-tab.png)

- Give your API key a name and click **Next**.
- Make sure that the **Smart Wallets** services are enabled, and any addresses that your deployed smart accounts interact with are added to the **Allowed Contract Addresses** section:

![Create API Key](/assets/dashboard/create-api-key-two-step.png)

- Click **Next** and then add your local host and production/preview domains to the **Set Access Restrictions** section. Click "Create" to create your key.
- Copy your **Secret Key** and store it in a safe place like a password manager. You will not be able to see this key again.
- Click **I Have Stored the Secret Key Securely** and your key will now be visible from the API Keys table.
- **Note**: to edit your private key at any point, click on the key from the table and then click on the **Edit** button.
- Copy your **clientId**. Since we are building a front-end application, we will need to use this key to build our application.

To use smart wallet infrastructure on mainnet you will also need to [create an account and add a payment method](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/billing).

## 3. Create an App

To use smart wallets in a React app you can either:

- Use [npx thirdweb create](/cli/create) command to create a new project with the dependencies already installed.
- Add the dependencies to an existing project using `npx thirdweb install` or your favorite package manager.

In this guide, we'll create a new project.

### Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

When prompted, select/input the following options:

- A name for the project
- `EVM` as the blockchain
- Select your desired environment e.g. `Next.js`
- `TypeScript` as the language.

This will create a repository.

## 4. Build your connection UI

### 4.(a) Using Connect Wallet

To use the [Connect Wallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component to connect your users to your app using smart wallet,
we need to pass a [`smartWallet`](/react/react.smartwallet) to the [`supportedWallets`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop in [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).

You can change the configuration based on your requirements,
but for this demo, we will enable **gasless transactions** and use a [localWallet](/react/react.localwallet) as the personal wallet.
You can learn more about the configuration [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.smartwallet).

```tsx
import { smartWallet, localWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const personalWallet = localWallet(); // or any other wallet

export const smartWalletConfig = smartWallet(personalWallet, {
  factoryAddress: "your-factory-address",
  gasless: true,
});
```

Pass the configuration to the provider:

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  clientId="<your-client-id>"
  activeChain={activeChain}
  supportedWallets={[smartWalletConfig]}
>
  <App />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

Now, import the `ConnectWallet` component from the React package and add it to your app:

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ConnectWallet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Clicking on the connect button will show the following Modal which allows you to create or import a local wallet.

This is the personal wallet you are using to initialize the smart wallet. For local wallet, you can create a new wallet with a password or import a previously created wallet.

![Connect Wallet](/assets/connect-wallet/connect-wallet-guest.png)

After connecting your personal wallet, a smart wallet is created for you and connected to the application:

![Connected Smart Wallet](/assets/connect-wallet/connect-wallet-smart-dropdown.png)

### 4.(b) Using the `useSmartWallet` hook

The [useSmartWallet](/react/react.usesmartwallet) hook allows you to programmatically connect your application to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useSmartWallet, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function Example() {
  // here we're using metamask as the personal wallet
  // can be any other wallet, including localWallet(), embeddedWallet(), etc
  const { connect } = useSmartWallet(metamaskWallet(), {
    factoryAddress: "0xE38fAC32BbA9F1Fe700a5D7f5630236171fa87e4",
    gasless: true,
  });

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        // nothing to do here, all handled internally
        const walletAddress = await connect();
        console.log("connected to smart wallet", walletAddress);
      }}
    >
      Connect
    </button>
  );
}
```

## 5. Use the Smart Wallet

Now that you have connected your smart wallet to your app, you can use it to send transactions and interact with smart contracts.

### 5.(a) Claim an NFT and fetch owned NFTs

Deploy a NFT Drop contract from the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/nft-drop) or build your own [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) compatible contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/erc721).

To claim an NFT, we will use the [useContract](/react/react.usecontract) hook to fetch the contract and the [Web3Button](/react/react.web3button) component to send the transaction.

```tsx
import { useAddress, useContract, useOwnedNFTs, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
// The ThirdwebProvider setup above already handles connection to the smart wallet
// Within the provider, you can use the react SDK hooks to interact with the blockchain
export default function MyComponent() {
  // Get the connected smart wallet address
  const smartWalletAddress = useAddress();
  // Fetch owned NFTs
  const { contract } = useContract("0x..."); // your nft drop contract
  const { data, isLoading } = useOwnedNFTs(contract, smartWalletAddress);
  // Mint a new NFT
  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={"0x..."}
      action={(contract) => contract.erc721.claim(1)
      }
    >
      Mint NFT
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
`;
```

## 6. Bonus: Add a Session Key

To add a session key to your smart wallet, you can use the [`useCreateSessionKey`](/react/react.usecreatesessionkey) hook to add a session key to the currently connected smart wallet:

```tsx
import { useAccountAdminsAndSigners } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const keyAddress = "{{key_address}}";

const Component = () => {
   const {
     mutate: createSessionKey,
     isLoading,
     error,
   } = useCreateSessionKey();

   if (error) {
     console.error("failed to create session key", error);
   }

   return (
     <button
       disabled={isLoading}
       onClick={() => createSessionKey(
         keyAddress,
         {
           approvedCallTargets: ["0x..."], // the addresses of allowed contracts or '*' for any
           nativeTokenLimitPerTransaction: 0.1, // the maximum amount of native token (in ETH) that the session key can spend per transaction
           startDate: new Date(), // the date when the session key becomes active
           expirationDate = new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // the date when the session key expires
         }
        )}
     >
       Create Session Key
     </button>
   );
 };
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how to connect users to a React app using two methods:

- With the Connect Wallet component.
- With a custom UI component via the `useConnect` hook.
- Low-level control with `ThirdwebSDKProvider` and the Wallet SDK.
