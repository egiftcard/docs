# Smart Wallet

Smart wallets are programmable wallets that provide a secure and convenient digital solution for managing and storing assets. In contrast to an [EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/), or externally owned account, smart wallets are instead a smart contract secured by code rather than private keys. 

:::info
Smart wallet factory contracts are fully compliant ERC-4337 spec. Learn more about ERC-4337 through the EIP proposal. 
:::

## Features

- **Operate with multiple parties** - Allow multiple owners on the same wallet to sign and transact. Assign specific roles and permissions such as signers and admins.
- **Limit access** - Limit access to specific functionalities or data within a smart contract via scoped session keys.
- **Execute transactions** - Execute batched and single transactions, send and receive tokens or NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155), and more with your smart wallet.
- **Ready-to-deploy contracts** - Easily deploy smart wallet account factories through pre-built contracts.
- **Composable Smart Wallet API** - Usable with already deployed ERC-4337 compatible factory contracts or bundler / paymaster services.

### Use Cases & Examples

- Create and manage wallets for users for applications such as games to provide a seamless and secure experience
- Configure games or applications with restrictions and gameplay tied to specific assets
