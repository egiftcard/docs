# Embedded Wallet

Embedded Wallet Service (EWS) is a simple yet powerful wallet infrastructure that enables apps to create, manage, and control their users' wallets.

- Delightful UX: No passwords, jargon, or downloads.
- Recoverable: Users can always access their wallets on other authenticated devices.
- Extensible: Email login, social login, and bring-your-own auth.
- Gas-less: Users do not require any crypto to interact with the blockchain.Yes. We support transactions using EWS for users who donâ€™t have gas tokens inside their wallet on any L2 chain or Ethereum (on request at sales@thirdweb.com).
- Peace of mind: No single point of failure. Private keys cannot be reconstructed by Paper or any developer of Paper without user authentication. The only owner of the wallet is your end user.

## Use cases

- Create user wallets without requiring web3/crypto knowledge or downloading an external app.
- Allow users to trade and sell NFTs or send ERC-20 tokens without worrying about gas. Paper manages the gas fees or can charge the user's credit card (depending on the blockchain).
- Allow users to always access their wallets on different devices without additional passwords.
- Enable users to connect to WalletConnect-compatible web3 apps. OpenSea, CollabLand, and thousands more!
- Airdrop NFTs to wallets generated by a list of email addresses.

## Features

### UX designed for the mainstream

Embedded Wallets are designed to onboard users with little to no web3 familiarity. A user signs in with their email address and is provided a functional wallet your application manages. Afterward, they can purchase NFTs with credit card, view NFTs they own, transfer NFTs, and send blockchain transactions without popups or gas.

Your customers don't need to learn technical jargon, buy cryptocurrency, or download third-party apps.

### Recoverable across devices

A user's assets are safe even if they lose their device! They can always log into a new device via a recovery password emailed to them when they first sign in.

Account recoverability reduces user frustration and customer support issues.

### Security first for peace of mind

**A private key is constructed on the user's device after they sign in.**

Paper uses threshold secret sharing cryptography to shard each private key to multiple, independent shards tied to the user's (1) device, (2) emailed recovery password, and (3) login authentication. The wallet is accessible with two of these three shards, which comes with several key advantages over standard wallets:

The wallet is not compromised if an attacker gets an individual shard.
There is no seed phrase that compromises the wallet if leaked or forgotten.
Users can recover their wallet from any of their devices.
Shards are always stored and transferred encrypted between the customer's device and Paper's server. The developer (you) and Paper are non-custodial and never able to reconstruct private keys when the user is not authenticated.

See Security & Privacy FAQ for more details.

### Simple to start, flexible to grow

The JavaScript SDK is designed to build a great out-of-the-box solution in minutes!

** Configure your app in the dashboard > Copy the SDK snippet > Done!**

As your product evolves, you can explore further customizing behavior and branding.

## Pricing & Billing

Charges are based on a monthly active user (MAU) model which is defined as any sign-in/sign-up inside your application.

The first `1,000 MAUs` is free. After that, we charge $0.03/wallet. See Pricing for more details.

**Volume discounts are available for enterprise customers. Contact us at sales@thirdweb.com.**

- A wallet is active when a user signs in or makes a transaction. Unlike competing wallet providers, you are not charged for inactive or idle wallets!
