# Getting Started

Make sure that you are developing on a [secure origin](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features/), which includes localhost and any site on https://. Paper uses cryptography libraries that are unsupported on http://

## Can the embedded wallet be used outside my app?

Yes! Your application's embedded wallets are able to use the My Wallets page to sign in to their wallet, view their NFTs, and connect to web3 apps via WalletConnect.

## Which blockchains are supported?

Ethereum, Sepolia, Goerli
Polygon, Mumbai
Optimisim Goerli
Binance Smart Chain and Testnet
Avalanche
Arbitrum, Arbitrum-Nova and Artbitrum Goerli

## How can my user transfer the NFT from their embedded wallet?

Buyers can visit My Wallets to view and transfer NFTs in their Embedded Wallets. We cover all gas fees related to transferring and offer a way for users to export their private key.

## How will my users recover their account in case they lose access to their auth?

Currently, users will rely on the built-in recovery of their auth method. Here is an example for Google.

Soon, developers will be able to toggle on the option for users to add a back-up auth method in the case the user loses access to their primary auth method & its recovery.

## Is there MFA/2FA for additional security?

Soon, developers will be able to toggle on the option for users to add additional security to their social wallet by adding a user-set password.

Does Paper support my existing auth system?
This feature is available upon request. Please contact sales@thirdweb.com.

## Can I white-label the wallet?

You can completely white-label the wallet experience and we provide API & SDK endpoints to make this easier. We currently have metadata APIs for NFTs, and a way to pull token balance.

## Do you support transaction signing?

We provide you with the signer through the SDK when the user is logged in to EWS in your application. This will allow you to create a custom signing experience for your app including signing transactions on behalf of users who are online.
