# Tokens

Tokens follow the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) "fungible token" standard, and typically represent a digital currency.

thirdweb currently has **two** types of Token contracts:

1. Token
2. Token Drop

## Which Token contract should I use?

If you want to release your tokens for a price or with [claim phases](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#setting-claim-phases),
the Token Drop contract is best suited for you.
