# Marketplace

The Marketplace is a contract where you can buy and sell NFTs, such as to OpenSea or Rarible.

The Marketplace contract allows you to list your NFTs for direct listing or for auction.
Other users can come and place offers/bids, or buy the NFTs for the amount that you specified in your listing.
If you choose to, other users can also list _their_ NFTs for sale on the marketplace too!

You could use the Marketplace contract to:

- Sell your NFTs on your own marketplace
- Create auctions where the highest bidder after a certain period of time wins the NFT
- Create an open marketplace where any user can list NFTs for sale, like OpenSea.

## Create a Marketplace Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployMarketplace"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Marketplace contract inside your application, you'll need to use it's contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"Marketplace"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Creating Listings

There are two types of listings in marketplaces.

1. **Direct Listings**:

- Sellers list their NFT for direct sale, with a price users can buy it for.
- The NFT remains in your wallet, but you provide permission for the marketplace contract to move the NFT.
- If a user pays the asking price, they will be transferred your NFT and the seller will receive the funds.
- Users can make offers below the asking price, and the listing can have multiple offers at once, the seller can choose to accept an offer at any time.
- Users can cancel their bids at any time.

2. **Auction Listings**

- Sellers list their NFT for auction, with a minimum asking price.
- The NFT is transferred to escrow in the marketplace contract until the auction is cancelled or finished.
- Other users can place bids until the auction is finished.
- Users can only make a bid if it is higher than the current highest bid (or asking price if there are no bids). A bid cannot be cancelled, and the funds are held in escrow by the auction contract.
- At the end of the auction, no more bids can be placed.
- At the end of the auction, both the **buyer** and the **seller** call the `closeAuction` function. When the **buyer** calls it, they are transferred the funds from the highest bid, when the **seller** calls it, they are transferred the NFT.

## Viewing Listings

### All Listings

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Marketplace"} name={"getAllListings"} />

### Active Listings

This filters out listings that have finished, been cancelled, or have already been bought out.

## Buying an NFT from a Listing

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Marketplace"} name={"buyoutListing"} />

## Auction Bid Buffers

We made a few important considerations when it comes to auctions in our smart contract.

- When someone makes a bid in an auction, the time until the auction is finished is extended by a set amount you can configure. This is to avoid users not bidding at the last possible second to win the auction.
- The user must bid a certain percentage higher than the current highest bid. This is to avoid users bidding miniscule amounts above the previous bid.
