# Pack

The Pack contract provides a flexible 'loot box' API.
Packs can contain arbitrary crypto assets as items, including exclusive NFTs or ERC20 tokens.
A pack can be opened in exchange for one or more items packed within.
The chance of receiving a particular item from the pack depends on how rare the item is.

:::info Coming Soon
The pack is not quite ready for use yet.
We are working hard to get it ready for you to use soon!
