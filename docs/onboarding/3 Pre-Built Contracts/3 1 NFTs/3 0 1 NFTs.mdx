# NFTs

NFTs are tokens that follow either the
[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) "non-fungible" or
or
[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) "semi-fungible" standard.

- ERC-721: Each NFT is unique and owned by a single address.
- ERC-1155: There can be multiple owners of each NFT.

thirdweb currently has five types of NFT contracts:

1. [NFT Drop](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop)
2. [NFT Collection](/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection)
3. [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition)
4. [Edition](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop)
5. [Pack](/pre-built-contracts/pack) _(coming soon)_
6. [Multiwrap](/pre-built-contracts/multiwrap)

## Which NFT contract should I use?

Below is a helpful table to demonstrate the differences between the contracts.
