You can build front-end applications by using our [React](/react) and [TypeScript](/typescript) SDKs!

Front-end applications are best-suited when you want users to connect their wallets to your web application and interact with your programs using their wallet.

### Learn By Example

Check out our [live demos](https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/) to see what you can build on Solana and how to build it.

<div className="row" style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Claim an NFT Drop"
      link="https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/nft-drop"
      image="/assets/icons/drop.png"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Mint & Display NFTs"
      link="https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/nft-collection"
      image="/assets/icons/nft.png"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Mint & Display Tokens"
      link="https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/token"
      image="/assets/icons/token.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Create A New Project

The easiest way to get started is by using the [CLI](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/thirdweb-cli).

```bash
npx thirdweb create app --solana --ts
```

You're project is ready to start interacting with your programs, tokens and NFTs on Solana.

<QuickstartCard
  name="Continue to the Interact with Programs section"
  link="/solana/programs"
  image="/assets/icons/education.png"
/>

## Integrate Into Existing Projects

If you have an **existing** project you want to integrate thirdweb into, install the thirdweb SDKs:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react @metaplex-foundation/js @project-serum/anchor @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui
```

Then wrap your application in the `ThirdwebProvider` to get started.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/solana";

// Change the network to the one you want to use: "mainnet-beta", "testnet", "devnet", "localhost" or your own RPC endpoint
const desiredNetwork = "devnet";

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider network={desiredNetwork}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Any page wrapped within the `ThirdwebProvider` has access to the features of the React SDK, such as:

- [`useWallet`](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/#usage) - Get the current wallet and its state
- [`useSDK`](/react/solana/react.usesdk) - Get the current SDK instance
- [`useProgram`](/react/solana/react.useprogram) - Get any deployed program instance

This setup is compatible with the [Solana Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) library. You can use any of the supported wallets.

### Existing Wallet Connection Setups

If you already have a connection and wallet setup using [Solana's web3js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/),
you can use the `ThirdwebSDKProvider` to access the SDK functions without any of the wallet management functionality.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDKProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/solana";
import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";

export const MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const wallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <ThirdwebSDKProvider network={"devnet"} wallet={wallet}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebSDKProvider>
  );
}
```
