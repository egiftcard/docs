# Getting Started

To get started using the Contract SDK to interact with contracts, there are two options:

1. Create a new project with the CLI which automatically sets up the relevant package(s).
2. Add to an existing project by installing the relevant package(s).

## 1. Create a New Project

To create a new project, use the thirdweb `create` command to setup the project and install the required dependencies:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript" label="TypeScript" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="GO">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{``}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Add to an Existing Project

To add to an existing project, install the relevant package(s) and import into the desired files:

install commands

For example, if I am working in React and I want to create a contract instance, I will use the `useContract` hook, which I need to install from the React SDK:

## Full Reference

How and what can be done with the SDKs depends on the required language. The same base set of functionality is included but consult the full references:
