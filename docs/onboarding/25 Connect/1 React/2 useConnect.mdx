## Connect A Wallet Without the Connect Wallet UI

The [`useConnect`](react/react.useconnect) hook allows you to programmatically connect to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useConnect, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const metamask = metamaskWallet();

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        const wallet = await connect(metamask, connectOptions);
        console.log("connected to ", wallet);
      }}
    >
      Connect to MetaMask
    </button>
  );
}
```
