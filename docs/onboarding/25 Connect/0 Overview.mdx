# Connect

thirdweb Connect is a complete toolkit for connecting wallets to applications. Connect provides **UI components, hooks, functions and connectors** which are all completely customizable, modular and work out-of-the-box, with no setup required.

Connecting to wallets can be done in three ways:

- Using the [`Connect Wallet`](/connect/connect-wallet) component.
- **Using hooks**
  - create your own user experience
- **Using the wallet SDK**:
  - Connect a wallet in a script in TypeScript.
  - Gain low-level control over wallet connections in your app with the ability to have fine-grain control over the configuration options.
  - Create custom wallet configurators to add to Connect Wallet.

Once you have connected a wallet using any of these methods, you can use the relevant SDK ([React](/react), [React Native](/react-native), [TypeScript](/typescript) or [Unity](/unity)) to interact with contracts e.g. sending transactions, reading data from contracts.

## Features
