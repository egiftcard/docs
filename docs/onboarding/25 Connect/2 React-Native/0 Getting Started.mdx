import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import GettingStartedLiveEditor from "@components/live-code/snippets/GettingStartedLiveEditor";

To get started, install the required dependencies into your React Native project.

```bash
npx thirdweb install
```

This will detect the environment and install the required dependencies.

<br />

:::info API Key
You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven't created a key yet you can do so for **free** from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
:::

## Wrap Your Application in ThirdwebProvider

Wrap your application in the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component to start using the SDK.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider activeChain="ethereum" clientId="your-client-id">
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Finally, we can run our app!

```sh
yarn android
```

```sh
yarn ios
```

<br />

## Connect Wallets to your App

With the provider set up, you can now connect users to your application & Connect Wallet works out of the box!

```jsx
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";

import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const AppInner = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.backgroundStyle}>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

[View this page for details on the `ConnectWallet`](/connect/react-native/connect-wallet) here.

Alternatively, create your own custom wallet connection using [useConnect](/connect/use-connect).

A list of the supported wallets can be found [here](/connect/react-native/supported-wallets).
If the wallet is not supported, you can [Create a Custom Wallet](/connect/react-native/custom-wallet).
