# SDK Connect Functionality

## Wallet SDK

You can use the Wallet SDK directly in any environment that supports TypeScript.
The Wallet SDK enables you to connect and create wallets which you can then use in your app to sign transactions as you usually would.
There are two main instances in which you would use the Wallet SDK directly:

1. Connecting wallets in a back-end environment such as Node.js script to sign transactions without passing a private key.
   Instead, a browser popup would be initiated to sign the transaction.

2. In projects where you need low-level control of the wallet

- Example: Needing to pass custom configuration options such as specifying a custom `execute` method for `smartWallet` e.g. [in this template](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/unilogin/tree/main).

## Wallet Actions

The SDKs provide a set of actions that you can use to interact with the wallet:

| Action                                                               | Description                                       |

## Build a Wallet Connector

If the wallet you want to use is not supported by the Wallet SDK or the Connect Wallet component, you can build a connector for it.

To build a connector and add it to the Connect Wallet component, [follow this guide](/connect/build-a-wallet).

## References

By using the thirdweb SDKs, you can easily connect and execute wallet actions.
