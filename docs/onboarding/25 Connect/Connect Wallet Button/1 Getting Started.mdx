### Pages Router

No additional configuration is required if you are using the [pages router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages)

<br />

### App Router

If you are using the new [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), and If you import a component such as `ThirdwebProvider` in a server component, Next.js will throw an error saying that the component is not marked with `"use client"` directive.

You will need to create an alias for that component in a separate file with `"use client"` directive on top (before all the imports) and import that instead of using the component directly from `@thirdweb-dev/react` in server components.

#### Example

```tsx
"use client";

export { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// app/components/ThirdwebProvider.tsx
```

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "./components/ThirdwebProvider";

export default function Home() {
  return <ThirdwebProvider> ... </ThirdwebProvider>;
}

// app/page.tsx
```

:::info API Key
You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven't created a key yet you can do so for **free** from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
:::

## Wrap your application in ThirdwebProvider

Wrap your application in the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component to start using the SDK.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider activeChain="ethereum" clientId="your-client-id">
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

<p style={{ opacity: 0.8, marginTop: -8 }}>
  <i>
    Examples of where to set this up: <a href="#cra">Create React App</a> •{" "}
    <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-javascript-starter/blob/main/pages/_app.js">
      Next.js
    </a>{" "}
    • <a href="#vite">Vite</a>
  </i>
</p>

<br />

With the provider set up, all of the SDK&rsquo;s hooks and components work out of the box!

Now you can connect to the user&rsquo;s wallet like so:

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
};
```

</div>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">
    <div>

Our SDK uses a [Provider Pattern](https://flexiple.com/react/provider-pattern-with-react-context-api/); meaning any component within the `ThirdwebProvider` will have access to the SDK.

Let's take a look at a typical setup:

## API Key

You will require an API key to use thirdweb’s infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

## Configure the `ThirdwebProvider`

Specify the network in the `activeChain` prop and specify the wallets to display in the Connect Wallet button by specifying an array to the `ThirdwebProvider` and wrap your application like so:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import {
  ThirdwebProvider,
  metamaskWallet,
  trustWallet,
  coinbaseWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

// provide supported wallets to ThirdwebProvider

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      supportedWallets={[metamaskWallet(), trustWallet(), coinbaseWallet()]}
      clientId="your-client-id"
    >
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Below is an example of where to set this up in your application:

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/react-native-typescript-starter/blob/main/App.tsx">
    Create React Native App
  </a>
</p>

Finally, we can run our app!

```sh
yarn android
```

```sh
yarn ios
```

## Using Connect Wallet

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";

import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const AppInner = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.backgroundStyle}>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

</div>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">
    <div>
    
The `ConnectWallet` prefab allows users to connect their wallet to your game.

It uses the [ThirdwebManager](/unity/ThirdwebManager) to determine which networks to display as well as the secondary UI related to certain providers such as WalletConnect.

You can set up which wallets you want to support from the Prefab_ConnectWallet Inspector directly.

When a user clicks the button, a dropdown of [supported wallets](#supported-wallets) will appear. The user can then
select their preferred wallet to connect to the game; once connected, the button will show the user&rsquo;s balance and an option to
switch networks if multiple networks are set up through the ThirdwebManager.

The prefab is located at: `Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Prefabs/Prefab_ConnectWallet.prefab`.

![Connect Wallet Button](../assets/connectwallet.png)

## Configuration

From the `Inspector` window, you can configure the options for the `ConnectWallet` prefab.

### Supported Wallets

The list of wallets you want to support.
Each wallet you provide appears as a button in the dropdown.

Supports `Injected` (window.ethereum), `MetaMask`, `Coinbase`, `WalletConnect`, `MagicLink`, `LocalWallet`, `Paper`, `SmartWallet`, `HyperPlay`.

Some wallet providers may not be supported on some native platforms.

### Custom Callbacks

Custom logic to run whenever an event occurs on the button, including:

- `OnConnected`: Triggered when the user connects their wallet successfully.
- `OnDisconnected`: Triggered when the user disconnects their wallet successfully.
- `OnSwitchNetwork`: Triggered when the user switches networks successfully.
- `OnFailedConnect`: Triggered when the user fails to connect their wallet.
- `OnFailedDisconnect`: Triggered when an error occurs after attempting to disconnect a wallet.
- `OnFailedSwitchNetwork`: Triggered when an error occurs after attempting to switch networks.
