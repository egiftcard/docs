Web3 API is currently in Open Beta and requires self-hosting. To try out hosted options, please [contact us](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us).

# Get Started

Once you have configured your self-hosted server, you can begin development with the Web3 API.

This guide will provide a few examples of how you can use the Web3 API:

### Get Balance

To quickly demonstrate how to use Web3 API in your application, let's create a quick JavaScript script that fetches your wallet's balance on a specific network using the `/wallet/{network}/getBalance` endpoint.

1. Create a `getBalance.js` at the root of your project’s directory
2. At the top of your file, let’s create a variable to store our network to pass into our path parameter.

   ```
   const network = "mumbai";
   ```

3. Configure your HTTP GET request

   ```jsx
   const options = {
     method: "GET",
     headers: {
       accept: "application/json",
       "content-type": "application/json",
       Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.THIRDWEB_SDK_SECRET_KEY}`,
     },
   };
   ```

4. Now we can use the `fetch()` function to make an HTTP GET request to our `wallet/${network}/getBalance` endpoint and display the result to our console.

   ```
   fetch(`http://localhost:3005/wallet/${network}/getBalance}`, options)
     .then((response) => response.json())
     .then((response) => console.log(response.result.displayValue))
     .catch((err) => console.error(err));
   ```

5. Run your script in the command using `node getBalance.js`
6. In the terminal, you will see the amount of Matic you have in your wallet returned.

### Deploy Contract

As an example for a POST method, let's modify our script to deploy an ERC20 Contract using `/deployer/{network}/prebuilts/token`

1. Create a `deployToken.js` at the root of your project’s directory
2. At the top of your file, let’s create a variable to store our network to pass into our path parameter.

   ```jsx
   const network = "mumbai";
   ```

3. Configure your HTTP POST request body. Modify the `primary_sale_recipient` to your address or the address you want to receive initial funds.

   ```jsx
   const options = {
     method: "GET",
     headers: {
       accept: "application/json",
       "content-type": "application/json",
       Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.THIRDWEB_SDK_SECRET_KEY}`,
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       name: "HelloWorldCoin",
       description: "A coin to demonstrate how to use Web3 API",
       symbol: "HELLO",
       primary_sale_recipient: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     }),
   };
   ```

4. Now we can use the `fetch()` function to make an HTTP GET request to our `/deployer/{network}/prebuilts/token` and return the URL for the deployed contract on the dashboard.

   ```jsx
   fetch(`http://localhost:3005/deployer/${network}/prebuilts/token`, options)
     .then((response) => response.json())
     .then((response) => console.log(`https://thirdweb.com/${network}/${response.result.deployedAddress}`)
     .catch((err) => console.error(err));
   ```

5. Run your script in the command using `node deployToken.js`
6. To find your contract, redirect from the link returned in the command line.
