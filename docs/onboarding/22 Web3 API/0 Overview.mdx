Web3 API is currently in Beta. To try it out, please [contact our business team](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us).

# Overview

Web3 API provides a server-side interface for contracts & wallets, without the complexities of wallet and transaction management.

It offers APIs for contracts, wallets, gas-less configurations & auth that allows developers to go to market and launch production grade applications with cross-EVM chain support with faster speeds, security, and reliability.

Building a decentralized application with a seamless user experience at scale requires setting up a backend infrastructure to create & manage wallets, deploy & interact with contracts, and handle user authentication. Web3 API removes this friction by eliminating blockchain constraints related to nonce, funds, gas, and key management.

## Features

- **Backend wallets:** Create backend wallets, store their keys securely via a cloud secrets manager like KMS, sign & send any transactions, and move funds at scale with nonce-management.
- **Smart wallets with shared custody:** Create managed, smart wallets with shared custody between the backend wallets & a userâ€™s EOA wallet.
- **Contracts:** Deploy, read, and write to any contract across any blockchain.
- **Auth:** Create permissions to enable users with wallets to directly interact with certain endpoints on the web3api.
- **Sponsored transactions:** Sponsor gas fees for any transactions through the web3 api.
