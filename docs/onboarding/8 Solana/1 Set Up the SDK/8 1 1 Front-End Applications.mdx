# Building Frontend Applications

You can build front-end applications by using our [React](/react) and [TypeScript](/typescript) SDKs!

Front-end applications are best-suited when you want users to connect their wallets to your web application and interact with your programs using their wallet.

#### Learn by example with our [Live Demos](https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/)

- [Minting page for NFT drops](https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/nft-drop)
- [Mint and Display NFTs](https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/nft-collection)
- [Mint and Display Tokens](https://solana-hub.thirdweb-example.com/token)

## Creating a new project

The easiest way to get started is by using the [thirdweb CLI](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/thirdweb-cli).

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-solana-starter
```

You're project is ready to start interacting with your programs, tokens and NFTs on Solana.

## Adding the SDK to an existing React project

If you have an **existing** project you want to integrate thirdweb into, install the thirdweb SDKs:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/solana @thirdweb-dev/react
```

Then wrap your application in the `ThirdwebProvider` to get started.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/solana";

// Change the network to the one you want to use: "mainnet-beta", "testnet", "devnet", "localhost" or your own RPC endpoint
const desiredNetwork = "devnet";

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider endpoint={desiredNetwork}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

This provider will handle Wallet management + SDK functionality. This gives you access to wallet management hooks like, as well as all the SDK hooks and components you need to interact with your program.

- `useWallet()` - Get the current wallet and its state
- `useSDK()` - Get the current SDK instance
- `useProgram()` - Get any deployed program instance
- and many more

This setup is compatible with the Solana Wallet Adapter library. You can use any of the supported wallets.

### Using the SDK with an existing Solana project

If you already have a connection and wallet setup using solana's web3js, you can use the `ThirdwebSDKProvider` to access the SDK functions without any of the wallet management functionality.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDKProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/solana";
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mainnet;

export const MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // If you want to use any custom provider or signer, add it here.
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const wallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <ThirdwebSDKProvider connection={connection} wallet={wallet}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebSDKProvider>
  );
}
```
