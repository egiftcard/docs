#### Build web3 apps on Solana using the JavaScript/TypeScript and React SDKs

- Interact with any Solana program.
- Create your own Token, NFTs and Drops.
- Interact with any existing Token, NFT or Drop.
- Do wallet actions like transfer, sign, and verify.

## Web apps

You can set up a new frontend application the CLI from our existing templates.

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-solana-starter
```

This creates a barebones Next.js application with the Solana and React SDKs already set up. Includes wallet connection logic and the SDK ready to use.

#### Continue to the [Frontend Applications](/solana-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend) section.

## Backend services and scripts

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/solana
```

This installs the Solana SDK for Node.js. You can use this to build backend services and scripts that interact with Solana programs.

#### Continue to the [Backend & Scripting](/solanasdk/set-up-the-sdk/backend) section.
