You can use the authentication SDK to verify the address of a client-side user on the backend.

The process involves two key steps:

1. The client-side user uses the `login` function to generate a login payload where they sign a login request message compliant with the [Sign-in with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) (EIP-4361) standard. They can then send this payload to the backend.
2. The server-side uses the `verify` function to securely verify the wallet address of the client-side user.

### Making a Login Request

This function allows the connected client-side user to sign an EIP-4361 compliant message and generate a payload that can be sent to the backend.

### Verifying the User Address

Then on the server-side, you can use the payload generated with the `login` method to extract the users' wallet address.
