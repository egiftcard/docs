thirdweb's drop contracts **lazy mint** your NFT and makes it available to be claimed by your users.

The **Edition Drop** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset and uses the [ERC1155 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), also known as "Semi-Fungible Tokens".

The Edition Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can mint an NFT, including allowlists, release dates, and claim limits.

You could use the Edition Drop contract to:

- Create NFT Memberships such as our [Early Access Cards](https://opensea.io/collection/thirdweb-community) that you want your users to claim
- Release an item in your game for a limited-time
- Create 100 NFTs based on one art piece, and allow users to claim one per wallet

## Smart Contract Design

For a detailed exploration of how our drop smart contracts work, why they were built, and their limitations, visit our [Drop Design Doc](/contracts/design/Drop)!

## Create an Edition Drop Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployEditionDrop"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Edition Drop contract inside your application, you need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"EditionDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Lazy Minting Your NFTs

### Using the dashboard

You can batch upload NFTs through the dashboard by uploading a `.csv` file or a `.json` file that contains the metadata of all your NFTs, alongside the assets (images, videos, etc.).

- You must include a `name` column for each NFT in the `.csv` or `JSON` file
- Asset file names must be sequential. E.g. `0.png`, `1.png`, `2.png`.

You can use our examples to get started:

- [Example CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/example.csv)
- [Example JSON File](https://nightly.thirdweb.com/example.json)

For a more in-depth guide on creating your NFTs in the Edition Drop contract, check out our guide [Create early access NFT](/guides/early-access-nft-with-typescript).

### Using the SDK

## Setting Claim Phases

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can mint an NFT.

You can have multiple claim phases that occur in sequence.

For each claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs do you want to drop
- How much do you want to charge per NFT
- What currency do you want to use
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims

### Using the dashboard

For a more in-depth guide on setting up your Edition Drop with multiple claim phases and an allowlist, check out our guide [Release an NFT Drop with an allowlist and multiple claim phases](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/create-nft-drop-with-claim-phases).

### Using the SDK

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs. For example, if somebody mints an NFT from your drop and then sells it to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab, you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"royalties"} />

## Minting / Claiming NFTs

With an Edition Drop contract, users claim NFTs by minting them into their wallets.
You can have a "mint" button that your users can click on each NFT in your edition.

### Using the dashboard

We have a pre-built embed that you can use to display your Edition Drop within your website.

You can access your Edition Drop's embed URL from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

## Airdrop NFTs

Airdropping means you send a wallet or a list of wallets with a configurable quantity of your NFT.

### Using the dashboard

Using the thirdweb dashboard, you can upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

You can download our example `.csv` file for airdrops [here](https://thirdweb.com/airdrop.csv).

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.

### Using the SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"airdrop"} />

## Viewing NFTs

Our SDKs provide helpful ways to view the NFTs in your collection.

### One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"get"} />

### All NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"getAll"} />

### NFTs owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Amount of tokens owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Transferring NFTs

Transferring NFTs means you can send this NFT to another wallet. You must be the owner of the NFT you're trying to transfer for this to be successful.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"EditionDrop"} name={"transfer"} />

## Burning NFTs

Burning is the process of removing the token from circulation by sending it to an inaccessible address. It does **not** delete the token from the blockchain.

### Using the dashboard
