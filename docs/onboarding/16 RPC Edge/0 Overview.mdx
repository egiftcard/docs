# RPC Edge

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Edge provides reliable access to querying data and interacting with the blockchain through global edge RPCs.

By default, we provide publicly available RPCs for over 900+ EVM Networks. [View the default RPC endpoints](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/infrastructure/rpc-edge) for each supported chain.

### Features

- **Reduced Latency:** Global edge caching enables reduced latency by using geographically distributed servers and caching RPC responses.
