title: Deploying Your Contract
---

You can deploy your contracts directly via the [CLI](/cli) or by using the [Release flow](/release) to create a **versioned** deployment of your contract.

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

Using this command will:

- **Compile** all contracts it finds in the current directory.
- Allow you to select which contract(s) you want to deploy.
- Upload your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS
- Open the deploy flow in the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for you to select one of our [supported networks](/guides/which-network-should-you-use) to deploy to
