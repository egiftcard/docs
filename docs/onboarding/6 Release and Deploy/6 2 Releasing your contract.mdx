# Release

Using the [CLI](/cli), run the following command to publish your smart contracts to the world's first **on-chain smart contract registry**;
where anyone view and deploy it from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

```jsx
npx thirdweb release
```

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Quickstart: Release & Deploy Your Own Contract"
      link="/getting-started/releasing-custom-contracts"
      image="/assets/icons/education.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Releasing Contracts

By releasing your contract onto the thirdweb registry, you unlock a way of creating **versioned deployments** of your contracts.
When you publish a new version, you can easily deploy it to any of our [supported networks](/guides/which-network-should-you-use)
in one click, without exposing your private key at any point.

We also create a public landing page for both your **wallet** and your **smart contract**, where the metadata, author, release notes, and
source code is all publicly available and stored on-chain.

These pages are accessible by anyone and allow users who visit them to:

- View the author and the source of the contract
- Call the functions of the contract directly from the dashboard using their connected wallet
- Deploy a copy of the contract themselves
