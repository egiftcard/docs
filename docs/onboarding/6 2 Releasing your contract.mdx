# Release

Using the [CLI](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/thirdweb-cli),
run the following command to publish a new version of your smart contract to our **on-chain registry**,
where anyone can view and deploy it from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

```bash
npx thirdweb release
```

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Quickstart: Release & Deploy Your Own Contract"
      link="/getting-started/releasing-custom-contracts"
      image="/assets/icons/education.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Releasing Contracts

By releasing your contract onto the thirdweb registry, you unlock a way of creating **versioned deployments**
of your contracts and have your contract source code stored on the blockchain.

When you publish a new version, you can easily deploy it to any of our [supported networks](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use)
in one click, without exposing your private key at any point.

We also create a public landing page for both your **wallet** and your **smart contract**, where the metadata, author, release notes, and
source code is all publicly available and stored on-chain.

These pages are accessible by anyone and allow users who visit them to:

- View the author and the source of the contract
- View the functions, variables, and [Extensions](/contract-kit) in your contract
- Deploy a copy of the contract themselves
