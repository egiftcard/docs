# Get Started

In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to build and deploy a full web3 application.

By the end, you'll have a project that allows you to mint NFTs into an ERC721A smart contract that you created!

If you prefer, you can create a fork our [Replit](https://replit.com/@thirdweb/getting-started) to explore the code directly.
