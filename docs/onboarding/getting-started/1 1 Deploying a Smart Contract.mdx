# Deploying a Prebuilt Contract

[Pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) are the quickest way to start building.

This page will show you how to deploy the [NFT Drop](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/nft-drop#create-an-nft-drop-contract) contract onto the Goerli test network.

Click the button below to go to the dashboard, where you can create and deploy your smart contract.

<div
  style={{
    width: "fit-content",
    marginBottom: 32,
  }}
>
  <DeployThisContractButton
    link={"https://thirdweb.com/contracts/new/pre-built/drop/nft-drop"}
    contractType="nft-drop"
  />
</div>

## Connecting Your Wallet

If this is your first time building in web3, you'll need a **wallet** to interact with the blockchain.

You can also get free **test funds** from a **faucet** to pay for the gas fees for your transactions.

Learn how to set up a wallet with test funds, and how test networks work below:

## Creating Your Contract

Before you deploy, you can set up your contract metadata such as the name, description, and image!

Beneath your contract metadata, select the `Goerli (GOR)` test network, and click `Deploy Now`!

:::tip Deploying Contracts with Code

You can deploy and interact with smart contracts using code via our [SDK](/sdk) too!

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Deploy An NFT Drop Contract With Code"
      link="/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#create-an-nft-drop-contract"
      image="/assets/icons/education.png"
    />
