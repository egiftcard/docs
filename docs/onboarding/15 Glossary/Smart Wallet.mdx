A Smart Wallet is a wallet that is controlled by a smart contract following the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

Ethereum has 2 types of accounts to transfer and receive tokens: EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) and Contract Accounts. A smart contract wallet is a wallet managed by a contract account 
instead of an EOA. A smart wallet is a wallet type requiring no private keys or seed phrases.
Smart contract wallets rely on code instead of private keys to secure and recover wallet information. 
Instead, you set _who_ and _under what conditions_, users may access the wallet via smart contracts. 

A smart contract wallet is a type of Web3 wallet powered by smart contracts.

This smart wallet is unlocked by a 'key' - a personal account. This key can be anything from a [MetaMask](/wallet/metamask) wallet or even a [Local Wallet](/wallet/local-wallet) and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the wallet.
