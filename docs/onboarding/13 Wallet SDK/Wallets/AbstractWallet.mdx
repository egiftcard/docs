title: Abstract Wallet
---

We have created an AbstractWallet that you can extend with your own wallet implementation. This is a useful blueprint if you want to 
implement your own wallets.

## Usage

```javascript
export class CoinbaseWallet extends AbstractWallet<WalletOptions<CoinbaseWalletConnectorOptions>>
...
```

### WalletOptions

The AbstractWallet exposes some options needed for the correct functioning of new wallets within our SDK. These options are:

```javascript
export type WalletOptions<TOpts extends Record<string, any> = {}> = {
  chains?: Chain[];
  walletId?: string;
  walletStorage?: AsyncStorage;
  dappMetadata?: DAppMetaData;
} & TOpts;
```

Notice we leave extra options for the wallet implementation to use. This is useful if you want to add extra options to your wallet.

### chains

The chains the wallet is going to support

### walletId

An id for the wallet. This is used to store the wallet in the wallet storage.

### walletStorage

Some wallets need to store data in persistent storage. This is the storage that will be used for that.

### dappMetadata

The dappMetadata is what the wallet will display when your DApp tries to connect to it. It is an object with the following 
properties and default values:

```typescript
dappMetadata: {
    name: "thirdweb powered dApp",
    url: "https://thirdweb.com",
    description: "thirdweb powered dApp",
    logoUrl: "https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico",
},
```
