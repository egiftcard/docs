title: Coinbase Wallet
---

The CoinbaseWallet allows you to connect to the Coinbase Wallet app in a simple and intuitive way.

As simple as:

```typescript
import {CoinbaseWallet} from '@thirdweb-dev/wallets'

const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet()
coinbaseWallet.connect()
```
Calling `coinbaseWallet.connect()` will open a QR Code modal and ask the user to scan it with their Coinbase Wallet.

We have set some sensible defaults for you, but you can also configure the wallet to your liking, read along!

## Configuration

The CoinbaseWallet constructor accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

```typescript
import {CoinbaseWallet} from '@thirdweb-dev/wallets'
import {Ethereum} from '@thirdweb-dev/chains'

const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet({
    // The dappMetadata is what the wallet will display when your DApp tries to connect to it
    dappMetadata: {
        name: "thirdweb powered dApp",
        url: "https://thirdweb.com",
        description: "thirdweb powered dApp",
        logoUrl: "https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico",
    },
    chains: [Ethereum],
    headlessMode: false, // If true, the wallet will not open a QR Code modal, but instead return a QR Code string
})

coinbaseWallet.connect()
```
