import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

The CoinbaseWallet allows you to connect to the Coinbase Wallet app or extension in a simple and intuitive way.

## Usage

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React" default>
<CodeBlock
language={"javascript"}
>{`import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet();
coinbaseWallet.connect();`}
</CodeBlock>

Calling `coinbaseWallet.connect()` will check if the Coinbase Wallet extension is installed and try to connect to it or open a QrCode modal otherwise and ask the user to scan it with their Coinbase Wallet.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native">
<CodeBlock
language={"javascript"}
>{`import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet();
coinbaseWallet.connect();`}
</CodeBlock>

Calling `coinbaseWallet.connect()` will try to open the Coinbase Wallet app on your mobile device where you can connect your DApp.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

We have set some sensible defaults for you, but you can also configure the wallet to your liking, read along!

## Configuration

For base configuration params please check the [Abstract Wallet](/wallet-sdk/abstract-wallet) configurarion parameters

```typescript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Ethereum } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet({
    headlessMode: false
})

coinbaseWallet.connect()
``` 

### headlessMode

If true, the wallet will not open a QR Code modal, but instead return a QR Code string
