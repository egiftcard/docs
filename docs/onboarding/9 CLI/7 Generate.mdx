# Generate

Preload ABIs and generate types for your smart contract to strongly type the thirdweb SDK.

By storing the ABIs, the [extensions](/solidity/extensions) on your contract can be detected and 
functionality unlcoked in the SDKs tailored to your smart contract. By storing the predownloaded ABIs locally, 
this **improves performance** by allowing you to make multiple function calls without having to make multiple network requests. 

## Command

```bash
npx thirdweb generate
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.generate.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
