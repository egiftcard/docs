# Login

Authenticate with the thirdweb CLI using your API secret key or replace an existing API secret key. You can find or create your API secret key at the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
By using an API key, you can access the thirdweb infrastructure and services which the CLI commands use under the hood such as storage. 

```bash
npx thirdweb login [options]
```

## Usage

If it's your first time using the CLI you will need to login with your API secret key in order to use the following commands:

- [Deploy](/deploy)
- [Publish](/publish)
- [Upload](/cli/upload)
- [Generate](/cli/generate)

Once you've logged in, your API secret key will be stored in your home directory for future use.

:::info
If you want to login with a different API secret key, you can use the `--new` flag to replace your existing API secret key.
:::

```bash
npx thirdweb login --new <api-secret-key>
```
