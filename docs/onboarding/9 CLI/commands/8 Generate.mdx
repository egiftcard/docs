# Generate

Preload contract ABIs and generate types for your smart contract to strongly type the thirdweb SDK.

```bash
npx thirdweb generate
```

## Usage

This command fetches the ABIs for all the smart contracts a given wallet address has deployed, and stores them locally
in the projects `node_modules/@thirdweb-dev/generated-abis` directory.

By storing the ABIs locally, both the [SDK](/sdk) and [CLI](/cli) can use them as a cache to improve the performance of your application; since
the ABIs no longer need to be fetched when using functions such as [`getContract`](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.smartcontract).

```bash
npx thirdweb generate [options]
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.generate.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
