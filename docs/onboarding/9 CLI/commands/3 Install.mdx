# Install

Install thirdweb dependencies into your project. If no path is specified, the current directory will be used.

```bash
npx thirdweb install
```

## Usage

By running this command, the type of your project is detected by inspecting the `package.json` file:

- **Smart contract projects**: [`@thirdweb/contracts`](/solidity) is installed.
- **App projects**: [`@thirdweb/react`](/react) and [`@thirdweb/sdk`](/typescript) and [`ethers` v5](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) are installed.

If any thirdweb package _(or Ethers)_ is already installed, they are updated to the latest compatible version.

```bash
npx thirdweb install <projectpath> [options]
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.install.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
