# Install

Install thirdweb into your project. If no path is specified, the current directory will be used.

By running this command, the type of project is detected and the relevant packages will be installed. 
If the packages already exist within the project, they will be updated.
For example, for a Next.js project, the React SDK and Typescript SDK will both be installed.

## Command

```bash
npx thirdweb install <projectpath> [options]
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.install.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
