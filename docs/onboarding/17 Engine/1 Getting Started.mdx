Engine is self-hosted with minimal configuration.

## Setup

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A thirdweb secret key from the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)

### Start the database

A Postgres DB instance is required to run Engine. [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql)/[Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) is recommended for production use.

Or run Postgres locally to get started quickly:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
```

This step provides a local Postgres DB URL for the next step:

```
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

### Start the server

Download and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run \
  -e THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY="<thirdweb_secret_key>" \
  -e ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS="<admin_wallet_address>" \
  -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="<postgres_connection_url>" \
  -e ENABLE_HTTPS=true \
  -p 3005:3005 \
  --pull=always \
  --cpus="0.5" \
  thirdweb/engine:latest
```

Provide the following environment variables:

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY`     | A thirdweb secret key created on the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).                                                                                               |
| `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS`    | The wallet address that will configure Engine from the thirdweb dashboard.                                                                                                                            |
| `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` | Postgres connection string: `postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`                                                                                               |
| `ENABLE_HTTPS`            | Self-sign a certificate to serve API requests on HTTPS. Set to `true` if running Engine locally to manage it from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine). (Default: `false`) |

Your server is running when this log line appears:

```bash
Server listening on: https://0.0.0.0:3005
```

:::tip

Here's a few pointers:

- `ENABLE_HTTPS=true` is only required when running Engine locally. Remove this line for production use.
- Make sure your Engine instance port (default: `3005`) is publicly accessible. All configuration and API requests require authentication.
- The `nightly` Docker image may contain new, undocumented, and possibly breaking changes. We appreciate feedback!

## Use the dashboard

### Sign in

To manage your Engine instance from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to [https://localhost:3005/json](https://localhost:3005/json).

   - The "Your connection is not private" page will appear.
   - Select **Show advanced** and select **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)** to render the JSON file.
   - _This one-time step allows your browser to connect to your local Engine instance._

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Sign in with the `<admin_wallet_address>` wallet.
1. Select **Set Engine instance URL to get started.**
1. Add your publicly accessible Engine URL.
   - If Engine is running locally, provide the URL `https://localhost:3005`.

### Overview

In the **Overview** dashboard section:

- View your backend wallets.
- Create a backend wallet.
- View recent transactions.
- Cancel a queued transaction.

### Explorer

In the **Explorer** dashboard section:

- Interactively view and call your Engine API.

### Configuration

In the **Configuration** dashboard section:

- Change backend wallet types.
- View webhooks.
- Add and remove webhooks.

### Permissions

In the **Permissions** dashboard section:

- View admin users.
- Add and remove admin users.
- View access tokens.
- Create and revoke access tokens.

## Use Engine

Use Engine to manage your backend wallets and call contract methods with one API call. Here's some examples:

### Get a wallet's balance

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/backend-wallet/<chain>/<backend_wallet_address>/get-balance",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    },
  },
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("Balance:", result.value);
```

### Read from a contract

This code example does not require gas funds and returns the function result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/read?functionName=balanceOf&args=0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    },
  },
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("ERC-20 balance:", result);
```

### Write to a contract

This code example calls a write method on a contract. It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
      "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      functionName: "transferFrom",
      args: [
        "0x1946267d81Fb8aDeeEa28e6B98bcD446c8248473",
        "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
        "0",
      ],
    }),
  },
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

### Deploy a contract

This code example deploys a [thirdweb NFT drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721). It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/deploy/<chain>/prebuilts/nft-drop", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contractMetadata: {
      name: "thirdweb Engine example",
      symbol: "eng",
      primary_sale_recipient: "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
    },
  }),
});

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

Engine can enable your application to airdrop NFTs, send funds between wallets, update on-chain game state, and more.

### Wait for a transaction to complete

Trigger an action when transactions complete by configuring [webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to call your backend server.

Alternatively, query or poll the `transaction/status/<queue_id>` endpoint:

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
  },
});

const { result } = await resp.json();
// status can be: processed, queued, sent, errored, mined, cancelled, retried
const isComplete = ["mined", "errored", "cancelled"].includes(result.status);
```
