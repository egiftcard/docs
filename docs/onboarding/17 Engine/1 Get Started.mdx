Engine is self-hosted with minimal configuration.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Docker
- Postgres DB
- A secret key from the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)


### Start the server

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run \
  -e ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS="<admin_wallet_address>" \
  -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="<postgres_connection_url>" \
  -p 3005:3005 \
  thirdweb/engine:latest
```

Provide the following environment variables:

| Variable Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `admin_wallet_address` | The initial admin wallet address that will configure Engine from the thirdweb dashboard. This wallet address must be the user that created `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY`. |
| `postgres_connection_url` | Postgres connection string: `postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]` |

### Configuration

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Add your publicly accessible Engine URL.
1. Configure Engine fields.
    1. thirdweb secret key
    1. [Wallet type](/engine/backend-wallets)

Engine is now configured and ready to use.

## Using Engine

### Create an access token

The Engine API requires a access token to authenticate requests.

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select the **Permissions** tab.
1. Under **Access Tokens**, select **Create Access Token**.
1. Provide the access token in the `Authorization` header when calling the Engine API:
    - `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

### Add a backend wallet

Engine uses your backend wallets to interact with the blockchain.
To create your first backend wallet:

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. On the **Overview** tab, select **Create** to create a wallet.

A local wallet is generated. Once gas funds are transferred to it, the backend wallet is able to send blockchain transactions.

See [Backend Wallets](/engine/backend-wallets) for more wallet options and configuration.

### Send a blockchain transaction

Call the blockchain with a backend wallet with one API call.

Here's an example of deploying a [thirdweb NFT drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721):

```ts
const resp = await fetch(`${engine_url}/deploy/{chain}/prebuilts/nft-drop`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    "x-backend-wallet-address": BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "contractMetadata": {
      "name": "thirdweb Engine example",
      "symbol": "eng",
      "primary_sale_recipient": "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373"
    }
  }),
})

// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
const { queueId } = await resp.json();
```

Engine can enable your application to airdrop NFTs, send funds between wallets, update on-chain game state, and more.

### Wait for a transaction to complete

To trigger an action when a transaction completes, use [webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to call an endpoint on your backend server.

Alternatively, query or poll the following endpoint:

```ts
const resp = await fetch(`${engine_url}/transaction/status/${queueId}`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
  },
})

// status can be: processed, queued, sent, errored, mined, cancelled, retried
const { status } = await resp.json();
const isComplete = ["mined", "errored", "cancelled"].includes(status);
```
