Engine is self-hosted with minimal configuration.

## Setup

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A thirdweb secret key from the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)

### Start the database

A Postgres DB instance is required to run Engine. [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql) or [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) are recommended for production use.

Or run Postgres locally to get started quickly:

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<db_password>" \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres
```

Your machine will run a local Postgres database at the URL `postgresql://postgres:<db_password>@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable`.

### Start the Engine server

Download and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run \
  -e THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY="<thirdweb_secret_key>" \
  -e ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS="<admin_wallet_address>" \
  -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="<postgres_connection_url>" \
  -p 3005:3005 \
  thirdweb/engine:latest
```

Provide the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` | A thirdweb secret key created on the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).
| `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` | The wallet address that will configure Engine from the thirdweb dashboard. |
| `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` | Postgres connection string: `postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]` |

:::info

Make sure your Engine instance port (default: `3005`) is publicly accessible. A valid auth token is required to configure or manage Engine.

:::

### Configuration

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Sign in with the `<admin_wallet_address>` wallet.
1. Add your publicly accessible Engine URL.

Engine is now configured and ready to use.

## Using Engine

### Create an access token

The Engine API requires a access token to authenticate requests. To create an access token:

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select the **Permissions** tab.
1. Under **Access Tokens**, select **Create Access Token**.
1. Provide an access token in the `Authorization` header when calling the Engine API:
    - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

See [Authentication](/engine/authentication) for advanced configuration.

### Add a backend wallet

Engine uses your backend wallets to interact with the blockchain. To create a backend wallet:

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Navigate to the **Overview** tab.
1. Under **Backend Wallets**, select **Create**.

A local wallet is generated, and the encrypted private key is stored in your database.

See [Backend Wallets](/engine/backend-wallets) for details on other wallet configuration or importing wallets.

:::tip

Send gas funds to this backend wallet in order to call contract write methods.

:::

### Send blockchain transactions

Call the blockchain with a backend wallet with one API call. Here are some examples.

#### Get a wallet's balance

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/backend-wallet/<chain>/<backend_wallet_address>/get-balance", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
  },
})

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("Balance:", result.value)
```

#### Call a contract read method

This code example does not require gas funds and returns the function result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/read?function_name=balanceOf&args=0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
  },
})

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("ERC-20 balance:", result)
```

#### Call a contract write method

This code example calls a write method on a contract. It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for  the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    function_name: "transferFrom",
    args: [
      "0x1946267d81Fb8aDeeEa28e6B98bcD446c8248473",
      "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
      "0"
    ]
  }),
})

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

#### Deploy a contract

This code example deploys a [thirdweb NFT drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721). It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for  the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/deploy/<chain>/prebuilts/nft-drop", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contractMetadata: {
      name: "thirdweb Engine example",
      symbol: "eng",
      primary_sale_recipient: "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373"
    }
  }),
})

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

Engine can enable your application to airdrop NFTs, send funds between wallets, update on-chain game state, and more.

### Wait for a transaction to complete

Trigger an action when transactions complete by configuring [webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to call your backend server.

Alternatively, query or poll the `transaction/status/<queue_id>` endpoint:

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
  },
})

const { result } = await resp.json();
// status can be: processed, queued, sent, errored, mined, cancelled, retried
const isComplete = ["mined", "errored", "cancelled"].includes(result.status);
```
