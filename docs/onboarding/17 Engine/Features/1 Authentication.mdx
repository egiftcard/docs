Engine can be managed via the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine) or [API](engine/api-reference).

## Dashboard access

The wallet address matching the `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` environment variable is the only user able to manage Engine from the thirdweb dashboard.

Granting Engine access to other users (wallet addresses) is coming soon.

## API access

Admins are able to create **session tokens** which are long-lived secret credentials that grant access to the Engine API.

### Creating a session token

1. Navigate to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select the **Permissions** tab.
1. Under **Session Tokens**, select **Create**.

:::tip

A session token is shown only once! Store it in a secure place, and revoke the session token if it is compromised.

### Revoking a session token

1. Navigate to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select the **Permissions** tab.
1. Under **Session Tokens**, find the session token to revoke and select **Delete**.
