### How do I wait until my transaction completes?

On the backend, use [webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to be notified when a transaction event occurs.

On frontend clients, use websockets:
```js
const socket = new WebSocket(
  "wss://<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>?token=<session_token>",
);
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const res = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("Received data:", JSON.parse(res.result));
};
```

### What is the `tx_overrides` argument?

`tx_overrides` is an optional body argument of some endpoints to override the gas and `value` field of the transaction.

Default values if ommitted:
- gas: estimated from contract simulation
- `value`: 0 (no funds sent)

### How do I customize the RPC URLs?

Set the `CHAIN_OVERRIDES` environment variable to the path to a JSON file or internet-accessible URL. The default value is `./chain-overrides.json` if found. See <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine/blob/main/chain-overrides.example.json" target="_blank">the example format</a>.

### Why is Engine unable to connect to my Postgres DB?

Here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure the Postgres DB is running in Docker:
  - In same container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `localhost`.
  - In different container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `host.docker.internal`.
- Ensure the Postgres DB connection URL and credentials are correct.
- Ensure the database name exists on the Postgres DB.
