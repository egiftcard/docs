## About Engine

#### Does Engine work with all thirdweb smart contracts?

Yes. Engine has intuitive interfaces to deploy prebuilt contracts, manage smart wallets, run a marketplace, and more.

#### Does Engine work with my non-thirdweb smart contracts?

Yes. Engine can read and write to any EVM contract with low-level API calls, including providing raw calldata. ERC-721 and ERC-1155 APIs can also be used for [contracts imported to thirdweb](https://support.thirdweb.com/smart-contracts/rtHYyzspnPaHmmANmJQz1k/importing-non-thirdweb-contracts-into-the-dashboard/hELLjgTc8TWrMdMEQkm2Es).

## Using Engine

#### How do I wait until a transaction completes?

APIs that call contract write methods (i.e. transactions sent from your backend wallets) enqueue an async job and return a corresponding `queueId`.

On the backend, use [webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to be notified when a transaction event occurs.

On frontend clients, use websockets:
```js
const socket = new WebSocket(
  "wss://<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>?token=<session_token>",
);
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const res = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("Received data:", JSON.parse(res.result));
};
```

#### How do I override gas settings?

The `tx_overrides` body argument to `POST /contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write` allows overriding gas values:

```json
{
  function_name: "...",
  args: [ ... ],
  tx_overrides: {
    gasLimit: 150000,
    gasPrice: 22000000000, // 22 gwei in wei
  }
}
```

#### How do I call a payable contract method?

The `tx_overrides` body argument to `POST /contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write` allows setting the `msg.value`:

```json
{
  function_name: "...",
  args: [ ... ],
  tx_overrides: {
    value: 1000000000000000, // 0.001 ETH in wei
  }
}
```

#### How do I customize RPC URLs?

Set the `CHAIN_OVERRIDES` environment variable to the path to a JSON file or internet-accessible URL. The default value is `./chain-overrides.json` if found. See <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine/blob/main/chain-overrides.example.json" target="_blank">the example format</a>.

## Troubleshooting

#### Why is Engine unable to connect to my Postgres DB?

Here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure the Postgres DB is running in Docker:
  - In same container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `localhost`.
  - In different container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `host.docker.internal`.
- Ensure the Postgres DB connection URL and credentials are correct.
- Ensure the database name exists on the Postgres DB.
