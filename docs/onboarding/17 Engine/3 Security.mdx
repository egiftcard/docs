## Best practices

Engine reconstructs signers for your backend wallets to sign and send transactions. Follow these best practices to secure access to your wallets and data:

- Securely store **access tokens** and **thirdweb secret keys**. Rotate these credentials if they are compromised.
- Use **labels** to keep track of your wallets, admins, and access tokens.
- Use access token with expirations to grant time-bound access.
- Regularly review the **admins** list to remove inactive and former team members.

## Data handling

- Since Engine is self-hosted, you (the developer) maintain control over the server, database, logging, and observability.
- Engine handles configuration data encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Backend wallet signers are reconstructed only in memory on your Engine instance, and this data is never sent to thirdweb or other external platforms.
- thirdweb may collect the following information:
  - Metrics on which accounts are using Engine
  - Anonymized metrics on usage
  - Transactions history
  - (TBD future data to power advanced analytics)

## Third-party security audit

As of October 2023, Engine is in the process of acquiring a security audit from an independent third-party.
