Engine is a self-hosted server that interacts with the blockchain with your backend wallets.

## Features

### Backend wallets

Create and manage backend wallets securely. Use local wallets to get started quickly or securely generate wallets in KMS without exposing the private key.

### Authentication

Create time-bound access tokens with scoped permissions. Grant or revoke programmatic access to your team as needed without worrying about private keys being compromised.

### Contracts

Deploy, read, and write any smart contract. Engine offers low-level contract calls as well as intuitive interfaces for common needs like transferring ERC-20 tokens.

### Smart wallets

Create and manage smart wallets for your users. Create session keys for scoped permissions.

### Gasless transactions

Attract a broader audience by sponsoring gas for your users. Enable users to buy, transfer, and sell NFTs with no additional friction.

### Webhooks

Get notified when transactions are completed to build powerful automation from blockchain activity.

### Analytics

View transaction history insights, event logs for each transaction, a ledger of backend wallet funds, and more.

> Advanced analytics are coming in Q4 2024.

## Benefits

### Scalability

To achieve high reliability during bursty traffic, blockchain calls are parallelized with smart retries. Engine protects your transactions against stuck nonces, gas spikes, and network instability.

### Ease of use

Engine manages complexities around wallet nonces, gas estimation, securing private keys, and more. This means developers can focus on their application's features and not web3 infrastructure.

### Security

Engine allows generating and managing KMS wallets where the private key is never accessed. Combined with scoped authentication tokens and fund monitoring, businesses visibility and control of their wallet assets.

## Use Cases

- **Minting API** - Use Engine to set up your own minting API, which allows you to provide free NFTs to users or sell NFTs using credit cards or cryptocurrency.
- **User Accounts** - Use Engine to deploy embedded (email) wallets for users using pre-built smart wallet contracts. Additionally, utilize backend wallets to create a gas-less and managed experience.
