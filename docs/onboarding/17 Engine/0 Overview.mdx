# Overview

Engine is a backend server with a simple API interface that lets developers create backend wallets and interact with blockchains using familiar HTTP calls to any EVM chain.

## Features

- **Backend wallets** - Create backend wallets and store their keys securely via a cloud secrets manager like KMS. Then, sign transactions and move funds all using backend calls.
- **Contracts** - Deploy, read and write any smart contract.
- **Smart wallets** - Create smart wallets for users and create session keys for backend wallets to manage assets inside these accounts
- **Sponsor gas** - Use Engine to sponsor gas for any transactions.
- **Analytics (coming soon)** - Monitor your blockchain transactions and funds flow.

## Benefits

- **Scalability** - To achieve high reliability during bursty traffic, blockchain calls are parallelized with smart retries. Engine protects your transactions against stuck nonces, gas spikes, and network instability.
- **Ease of use** - Engine abstracts blockchain complexities around nonce, gas, signers, private key security and others. It enables any developer to quickly build sophisticated web3 applications with a low barrier of entry.
- **Security -** Engine allows developers to back up private keys to the cloud, revoke access to backend wallets, and monitor flow of funds (coming soon).

## Use Cases

- **Minting API** - Use Engine to set up your own minting API, which allows you to provide free NFTs to users or sell NFTs using credit cards or cryptocurrency.
- **User Accounts** - Use Engine to deploy embedded (email) wallets for users using pre-built smart wallet contracts. Additionally, utilize backend wallets to create a gas-less and managed experience.
