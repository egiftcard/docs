Engine is a backend HTTP server that lets you interact with smart contracts
using managed backend wallets.

- <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>
    Create & manage funded backend wallets
  </strong> and use these wallets to send transactions to the blockchain via authenticated
  APIs.
- <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>
    Engine handles the challenges of building scalable blockchain apps
  </strong> with transaction queueing & retrying, wallet nonce management, and gas
  management.
- <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>Offer the best UX to your users</strong> by
  deploying & transacting with smart wallets on behalf of users, enabling sign-less
  flows, and sponsoring transactions.
- <strong style={{ color: "white" }}>
    Engine comes complete with its own infrastructure
  </strong> so you don't need to manage your own - including RPCs, IPFS, and account
  abstraction infrastructure.

Engine is also fully [open-sourced](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine) and [self-hostable](/engine/getting-started) - we're improving it daily and welcome your feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/thirdweb)!
