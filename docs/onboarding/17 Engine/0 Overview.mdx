> **Engine is a self-hosted server that replaces your web3 infrastructure stack.**

Your application backend calls authenticated APIs to execute transactions, manage smart wallets, handle wallet funds, and more. Get production-ready quickly with out-of-the-box permissions, transaction retries, backend wallet cloud backups, and event webhooks. Battle-tested RPC, IPFS, and account abstraction infrastructure provided by thirdweb is built-in.

## Features & capabilities

**Free & open source**

Engine is [open source](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine) and core features be free, forever. Advanced paid features will be offered in the future.

**Backend wallets**

Manage your multiple backend wallets securely. Get started quickly with [local wallets](/wallet/local-wallet) or generate wallets backed by AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS without exposing the private key.

Your backend wallets are never accessed by thirdweb. Learn more about [Security](/engine/security).

**Dashboard and API authentication**

Control API access with scoped permissions (coming soon) and expirations.

Grant or revoke team member access without worrying about private keys being compromised. No more rotating wallet private keys when your team changes!

**Any contract support**

Read and write to any smart contract with low-level contract calls and intuitive APIs for common actions like transferring ERC-20 tokens and minting ERC-721 NFTs.

Deploy any [published smart contract](https://thirdweb.com/explore) including tokens, NFTs, marketplaces, smart accounts, and more.

**High transaction throughput**

Support traffic spikes with built-in resilience. Blockchain transactions are submitted in parallel with nonces managed behind the scenes. Transactions stuck due to gas spikes or network instability are automatically retried. Monitor and cancel/retry transactions from the API or dashboard.

**Smart wallets**

Provide a seamless UX for your users by creating and managing smart wallets. Use session keys to restrict interactions for specific times or contracts.

**Gasless transactions**

Expand your audience by sponsoring gas for your users, enabling them to buy, transfer, and sell NFTs without added friction.

**Wallet and contract webhooks**

Get notified of wallet and contract events to build powerful automations. Send emails, print shipping labels, or charge customers based on your unique needs.

> Contract events support is coming soon.

**Advanced analytics**

View transaction history trends, event logs for each transaction, a ledger of backend wallet funds, and more.

> Coming soon.

**Any EVM chain support**

Engine supports [all 1000+ EVM chains](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist).

## Use cases

**Airdrops at scale**

Need to mint NFTs to users? Engine manages a fleet of backend wallets to call your contract at scale. Gas estimation, nonce management, and smart retries are included. Monitor recent transactions and wallet balances in the dashboard.

See our [Airdrop NFTs guide](/guides/engine/airdrop-nfts).

**Fiat NFT checkouts**

Expand your audience by accepting any fiat or cryptocurrency payment method. Bring your own payment provider, charge the buyer, and deliver an NFT upon payment.

Looking for a simpler solution? See [thirdweb Checkouts](https://thirdweb.com/checkout).

**App accounts with seamless wallet UX**

Deploy and manage prebuilt smart wallet contracts. Your backend wallets can share ownership and handle blockchain interactions behind the scenes.

## Why use Engine?

Engine is beneficial if your app:

- Handles multiple company app wallets.
- Requires controlled access by multiple team members.
- Requires transactions to be delivered reliably during traffic bursts and network congestion. 
- Sends more than one transaction per block (example: 2 Ethereum transactions within 12 seconds).
- Sponsors gas fees for your users.
- Deploys smart accounts for each user.
- Triggers other actions when wallet or contract events occur.

## Why _not_ use Engine?

Engine may not be beneficial if your app:

- Does not have a backend.
    - Coming soon: Grant user wallets limited-scope access to your backend wallets.
- Requires users to send transactions from their wallets instead of your backend wallets.
    - Use the [thirdweb Contract SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk).
