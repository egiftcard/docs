**Engine is a self-hosted server that reads and writes to any contract on any EVM blockchain with your backend wallets.**

Your application backend calls authenticated APIs to execute transactions, manage smart wallets, handle wallet funds, and more. Get production-ready with built-in wallet security, access tokens, automatic retries, and nonce management. Thirdweb infrastructure (RPC providers, IPFS, Account Abstraction) are included out of the box.

## Features

**Backend wallets**

Create and manage backend wallets securely. Use [local wallets](/wallet/local-wallet) to get started quickly, or generate wallets securely backed by AWS KMS or Google KMS without ever exposing the private key.

> Backend wallets are owned by your application and never accessed by thirdweb.

**Authentication**

Generate access tokens with scoped permissions and expirations. Grant or revoke programmatic access to your team as needed without worrying about private keys being compromised.

**Contracts**

Deploy, read, and write any smart contract. Engine offers low-level contract calls as well as intuitive APIs for common actions like transferring ERC-20 tokens.

**Smart wallets**

Create and manage smart wallets for your users. Create session keys for scoped permissions.

**Gasless transactions**

Attract a broader audience by sponsoring gas for your users. Enable users to buy, transfer, and sell NFTs with no additional friction.

**Webhooks**

Get notified when transactions complete to build powerful automation from blockchain activity. Send emails, print shipping labels, or charge customers based on your unique needs.

**Advanced analytics**

View transaction history trends, event logs for each transaction, a ledger of backend wallet funds, and more.

> Advanced analytics are coming in Q4 2023.

## Benefits

**Scalability**

To achieve high reliability during bursty traffic, blockchain calls are parallelized with smart retries. Engine protects your transactions against stuck nonces, gas spikes, and network instability.

**Ease of use**

Engine manages complexities around wallet nonces, gas estimation, securing private keys, and more. This means developers can focus on their application's features and not web3 infrastructure.

**Security**

Engine allows generating and managing KMS wallets where the private key is never accessed. Combined with scoped authentication tokens and fund monitoring, businesses visibility and control of their wallet assets.

## Use Cases

- **Minting API** - Use Engine to set up your own minting API, which allows you to provide free NFTs to users or sell NFTs using credit cards or cryptocurrency.
- **User Accounts** - Use Engine to deploy embedded (email) wallets for users using pre-built smart wallet contracts. Additionally, utilize backend wallets to create a gas-less and managed experience.
