# Embed

Embed is a component that allows you to embed your contract into a front end easily.

## Configuration

Configure the setting of the embed component:

- The RPC endpoint to connect to the blockchain
- Whether transactions are [gasless](/glossary/gasless-transactions) for the end users.
  This allows you to select and configure either Biconomy or OpenZeppelin Defender as the gas relayer.
- Light or Dark mode (selecting `System` will use the user's system preference)
- Primary color to be used for the main actions button backgrounds.
