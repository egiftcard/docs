# Dashboard

Using [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) you can deploy, interact with, and manage your contracts, configure storage, RPCs, Wallets and more.

The dashboard allows you to [deploy](/deploy) or import any contract on an EVM-compatible network and manage settings.

Some actions enabled through dashboard:

- Updating contract metadata
- Uploading single or batch NFTs
- Transferring, burning, or airdropping NFTs
- Setting claim conditions (on contracts which implement the [Claimable](/solidity/extensions/erc721claimable), [Drop](/solidity/extensions/drop) or [DropSinglePhase](/solidity/extensions/dropsinglephase) extensions)
- Managing contract permissions (on contracts which implement the [Permissions](/solidity/extensions/permissions) extension)

## Unlocking Dashboard Features

All contracts come with a set of default views, including:

- [Build](/dashboard/build)
- [Explorer](/dashboard/explorer)
- [Events](/dashboard/events)
- [Settings](/dashboard/settings)
- [Sources](/dashboard/sources)

For each contract you deploy using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) or the [CLI](/cli) or import,
you unlock features in the dashboard for each [extension](/solidity/extensions) you implemented in your contract.
