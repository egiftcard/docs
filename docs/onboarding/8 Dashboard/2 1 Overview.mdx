# Dashboard

Using [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) you can deploy, interact with, and manage all your contracts, programs, configure storage, RPC, and more.

The dashboard allows you to deploy or import any EVM compatible contract and manage settings.

Some actions enabled through dashboard:

- Updating contract metadata
- Uploading single or batch NFTs
- Transferring, burning, or airdropping NFTs
- Setting claim conditions (certain contracts)
- Managing contract permissions

## Unlocking Dashboard Features

All prebuilt contracts come with a set of default views, including:

- [Build](/dashboard/build)
- [Explorer](/dashboard/explorer)
- [Events](/dashboard/events)
- [Settings](/dashboard/settings)
- [Sources](/dashboard/sources)

For each contract you deploy using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) or the [CLI](/cli),
you unlock features in the dashboard for each [extension](/solidity/extensions) you implemented in your contract.
