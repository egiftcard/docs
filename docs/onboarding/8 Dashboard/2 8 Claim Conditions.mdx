# Claim Conditions

:::info
This feature is available for all contracts which implement the [Drop](/solidity/extensions/drop) or [DropSinglePhase](/solidity/extensions/dropsinglephase) extensions.
:::

Claim Conditions are the rules that govern who can claim and how much they can claim. You can set Claim Conditions for each phase of your Drop.

## Set Claim Conditions

:::info Prebuilt Contracts
[Signature Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/SignatureDrop) does not have multiple claim phases. If you'd prefer to have multiple claim phases as part of a Drop, we recommend using the [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721) contract.
