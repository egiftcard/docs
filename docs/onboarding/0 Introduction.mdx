# Welcome to thirdweb

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>
<p>thirdweb is a web3 application framework that allows you to build powerful, 
  blockchain-based applications more easily, with tools to use at all layers of your development stack:</p>

1. **Smart Contracts** for you to deploy and tools to support building them.
2. **SDKs** to interact with the blockchain in your favorite languages.
3. **Dashboards** to create, configure, and deploy contracts.

## Contracts

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>
  <p>Smart Contracts are the fundamental layer of any web3 project.</p>
  
  <p>
  They're responsible for storing your applications' data on the blockchain.
  </p>

You can deploy one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts), or use
[thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy) to give you all of thirdweb's capabilities
in your contract.

<p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Our pre-built contracts are:</p>

- 100% open-source on GitHub
- Consistently audited by trusted firms
- Fully owned by the wallet used to deploy them
- **10x cheaper** to deploy (through the use of proxy contracts)

## SDKs

<div className="heroGrid">
  <div>
    <p>
      We provide SDKs to interact directly with your smart contracts in your
      favorite languages, including:

  </div>
</div>

thirdweb's SDKs are the connection between your application and your smart contracts.

They do the heavy lifting, including:

- Connecting to the blockchain via RPC
- Configuring networks you want to support
- Resolving metadata from IPFS
- Caching results for faster responses

## Dashboard

<div className="heroGrid">
  
  <div>
    <p>
      The <a href='https://thirdweb.com/dashboard'>dashboard</a> is an interface where you can deploy and interact with your smart contracts.
    </p>

You can perform the most common admin operations for your projects without any code, such as:

- Deploy new smart contracts
- Configure royalty and platform fees
- Upload metadata and mint NFTs
- Share access with your team

</div>

<div className="heroGridImageContainer">
  <Image
    img={require(`/assets/portal_imgs_1-02.png`)}
    className="heroGridImage"
    alt="thirdweb Dashboard"
  />
</div>

</div>

We also provide simple code snippets for you to get started and give you
visual representations of what is happening on your smart contract; like all
the NFTs that have been minted in your collection, or what is currently listed
on your marketplace.
