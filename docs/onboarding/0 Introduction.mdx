## Deploy

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>
  <p>Deploying smart contracts is the first step of building any web3 application.</p>
  
  <p>With thirdweb, you can deploy any smart contract with a single button-click or command.</p>

You can deploy one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) for more common use cases (like NFTs, Tokens, and more),
or you can deploy your own smart contract with a single command using the [thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy) flow.

<p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Our pre-built contracts are:</p>

- Fully **open-source** on GitHub
- Consistently **audited** by trusted firms
- **10x cheaper** to deploy than ordinary smart contracts (through the use of proxy contracts)
- Completely owned by the wallet used to deploy them

## Build

    <p>
      We provide a diverse set of tools to help you build your applications with whatever languages
      and frameworks you are most comfortable using:
    </p>

We have **SDKs** to handle interaction with you contracts in multiple languages:

<p>And we offer <strong>plug-and-play frontend components</strong> to help you build elegant user interfaces around your smart contract functionality.</p>

## Manage

<div className="heroGrid">
  
  <div>
    <p>
      We provide you with an inuitive <a href='https://thirdweb.com/dashboard'>dashboard</a> to manage your applications.
    </p>

The dashboard lets you easily perform common admin operations for your projects without any code, such as:

- **Deploying** new smart contracts and **interacting** with current contracts
- **Configuring** royalty and platform fees or other contract settings
- Issuing team-wide **permissions** to enable collaboration
- Gathering **insights** from your smart contract analytics
