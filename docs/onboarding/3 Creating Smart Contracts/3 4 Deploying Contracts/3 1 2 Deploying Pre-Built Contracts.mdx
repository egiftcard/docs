# Deploying Pre-Built Contracts

Pre-built contracts can be deployed using either the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/contracts/new) or the [SDK](/smart-contracts/deploying-pre-built-contracts#sdk-contract-deployments).

<div className="row" style={{marginBottom:24}}>

<div className="col col--6" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Dashboard Quick Start (NFT Drop)"
    link="/getting-started/deploying-contracts"
    image="/assets/icons/token.png"
  />
</div>

<div className="col col--6" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Create an NFT Drop with TypeScript"
    link="/guides/create-a-drop-with-typescript-sdk"
    image="/assets/icons/drop.png"
  />
</div>

We have four categories of pre-built contracts for you to deploy:

Learn more about each category in the [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) section, or by clicking on the links below.

## Dashboard Contract Deployments

The [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) is the easiest way to deploy contracts and doesn't require any code.

![Choose a contract from the dashboard](../assets/choose-contract.png)

To get started deploying and contract on the dashboard, check out our guide below:

<div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Release an NFT drop on your own site without writing any code"
    link="/guides/release-an-nft-drop-with-no-code"
    image="/assets/icons/drop.png"
  />
</div>

## SDK Contract Deployments

Any of our pre-built contracts can be deployed via the SDK.

This enables use-cases where you can have users deploy their own contracts after connecting their wallet to your application,
or simply as an alternative to deploying via the dashboard.

_For example, to create an NFT Drop contract:_

<DeployingContractsCodeTabs />
