# ERC-721 Signature Mint

The `ERC721SignatureMint` smart contract uses the [ERC721Base](/solidity-sdk/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base) base contract along with the `SignatureMintERC721` contract extension.

The 'signature minting' mechanism in the `SignatureMintERC721` extension uses [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), and is a way for a contract admin to authorize an external party's request to mint tokens on the admin's contract.

At a high level, this means you can authorize some external party to mint tokens on your contract, and specify what exactly will be minted by that external party.
