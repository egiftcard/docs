# ERC-721 Delayed Reveal

The `ERC721DelayedReveal` smart contract uses the [ERC721LazyMint](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/base/ERC721LazyMint.sol) base contract along with the `DelayedReveal`contract extension.

'Delayed reveal' is a mechanism by which you can distribute NFTs to your audience and reveal the metadata of the distributed NFTs, after the fact.

You can read more about how the `DelayedReveal` extension works, [here](https://blog.thirdweb.com/delayed-reveal-nfts).
