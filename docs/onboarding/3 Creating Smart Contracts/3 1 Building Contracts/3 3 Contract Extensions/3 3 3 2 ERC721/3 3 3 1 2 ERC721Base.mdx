# ERC-721 Base Contract

The `ERC721Base` contract is for creating an NFT Collection that follows the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
"Non-Fungible Token" standard. It utilizes the [ERC-721A](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a) "Azuki" standard for gas optimizations when minting multiple NFTs at once,
along with several contract extensions common for NFT Collections outlined below.

## Available Functionality

Below is a table outlining what functionality is available in the `ERC721Base` contract.

| Functionality                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [ERC721A](https://www.erc721a.org/)                                    | Gas-optimized NFT Collection Base Contract.                                                                                                                                       |
| [Mintable](/solidity-sdk/contract-extensions/mintable)                 | Mint functionality (only callable by the owner, by default) with gas-optimized batch minting enabled by ERC721A functionality.                                                    |
| [Multicall](/solidity-sdk/contract-extensions/multicall)               | Capability for better developer experience for your contract; the ability to batch together multiple contract calls in a single call.                                             |
| [Ownable](/solidity-sdk/contract-extensions/ownable)                   | Ownership of the contract for the contract deployer, and (1) the ability to transfer this ownership, and (2) restrict functions to be callable only by the owner of the contract. |

| [ContractMetadata](/solidity-sdk/contract-extensions/contractmetadata) | Set a metadata URI on the contract, to give your collection a name, image, description and symbol.                                                                                |

## Implementing the Contract Extension

First, import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {} // Error: Contract "MyNFT" should be marked as abstract.
```

Add a constructor that configures the contract-level metadata when you deploy the contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {

	  constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        string memory _contractURI,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _contractURI,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {}

}
```
