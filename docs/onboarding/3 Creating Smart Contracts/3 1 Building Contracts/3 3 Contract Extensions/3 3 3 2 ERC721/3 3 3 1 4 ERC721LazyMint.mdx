# ERC-721 Lazy Mint

The `ERC721LazyMint` smart contract uses the [ERC721Base](/solidity-sdk/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base) base contract along with the `LazyMint` contract extension.

'Lazy minting' means defining the metadata of NFTs without minting it to an address. Regular 'minting' ofÂ  NFTs means actually assigning an owner to an NFT.

As a contract admin, this lets you prepare the metadata for NFTs that will be minted by an external party, without paying the gas cost for actually minting the NFTs.

## Implementing the Contract

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721LazyMint.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721LazyMint {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721LazyMint(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
}
```

## Unlocked Features

The `ERC721SignatureMint` smart contract is open source and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/base/ERC721LazyMint.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK: extensions used by `ERC721Base`, `LazyMint`.
