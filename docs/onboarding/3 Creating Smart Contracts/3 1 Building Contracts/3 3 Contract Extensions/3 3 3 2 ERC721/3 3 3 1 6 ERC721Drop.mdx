# ERC-721 Drop

The `ERC721Drop` smart contract uses the [ERC721SignatureMint](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/base/ERC721SignatureMint.sol) base contract along with the `LazyMint`, `DelayedReveal` and `DropSinglePhase` contract extension.

The `drop` mechanism in the `DropSinglePhase` extension is a distribution mechanism for lazy minted tokens. It lets you set restrictions such as a price to charge, an allowlist etc. when an address attempts to mint lazy minted tokens.

The `ERC721Drop` contract lets you lazy mint tokens, and distribute those lazy minted tokens via signature minting, or via the drop mechanism.
