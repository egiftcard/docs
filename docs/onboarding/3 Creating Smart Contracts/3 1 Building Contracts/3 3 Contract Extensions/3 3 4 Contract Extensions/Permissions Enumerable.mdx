# Permissions Enumerable

The `PermissionsEnumberable` smart contract extension is usable with any base smart contract. It is built upon the `Permissions` contract extension, and exposes convenient methods to fetch all wallets that hold a given role.

## Available functionality

| Functionality        | Description                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getRoleMember`      | Use with getRoleMemberCount to get all wallets that hold a given role. |
| `getRoleMemberCount` | Returns the number of wallets that hold a given role.                  |

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumerable.sol";

// Usage is the same as `extensions/Permissions.sol`

contract MyContract is Permissions {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `Permissions` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we grant the deployer of the contract this admin role.
     */
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     *  EXAMPLE: here we have a function that we want to restrict only to holders of `NUMBER_ROLE`.
     *
     *  To accomplish this, we use the `onlyRole` modifier made available by `Permissions`, and
     *  pass it `NUMBER_ROLE` as an argument.
     */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## Unlocked Features

The `Permissions` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Ownable.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contractâ€™s Permissions features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractmetadata).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to manage roles on your smart contract.
