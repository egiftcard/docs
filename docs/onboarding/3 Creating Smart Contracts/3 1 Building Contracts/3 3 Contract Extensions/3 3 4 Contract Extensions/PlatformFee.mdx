# Platform Fee

The `PlatformFee` smart contract extension is usable with any base smart contract. “Platform fee” is a generic fee that you can choose to charge in your smart contract, wherever there is a transfer of currency. The `PlatformFee` extension lets you set a recipient and a % for this generic fee.

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PlatformFee.sol";

contract MyContract is PlatformFee {
    /**
     *  We store the contract deployer's address only for the purposes of the example
     *  in the code comment below.
     *
     *  Doing this is not necessary to use the `PlatformFee` extension.
     */
    address public deployer;

    constructor() {
        deployer = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set platform fee info for your contract.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the contract deployer to set the platform fee info.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `PlatformFee` extension.
     */
    function _canSetPlatformFeeInfo() internal virtual override returns (bool) {
        return msg.sender == deployer;
    }
}
```

## Unlocked Features

The `PlatformFee` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contract’s `PlatformFee` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to set platform fee information for your contract.
