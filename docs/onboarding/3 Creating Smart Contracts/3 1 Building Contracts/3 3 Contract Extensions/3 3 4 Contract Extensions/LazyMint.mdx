# Lazy Mint

The `LazyMint` smart contract extension is meant to be used with any ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT smart contract. It lets you 'lazy mint' any number of NFTs at once.

'Lazy minting' means defining the metadata of NFTs without minting it to an address. Regular 'minting’ of NFTs means actually assigning an owner to an NFT. As a contract admin, this lets you prepare the metadata for NFTs that will be minted by an external party, without paying the gas cost for actually minting the NFTs.

| `lazyMint`     | Prepare the metadata for NFTs that will be minted by an external party, without paying the gas cost for actually minting the NFTs. |
| `_canLazyMint` | Defines the criteria a wallet must meet to be able to lazy mint NFTs.                                                              |

## Implementing the Contract extension.

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

## Unlocked Features

The `LazyMint` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contract’s `LazyMint` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to set royalty information for your NFT contract.
