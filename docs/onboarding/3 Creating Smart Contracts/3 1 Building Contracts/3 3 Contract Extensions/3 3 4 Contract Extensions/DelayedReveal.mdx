# Delayed Reveal

The `DelayedReveal` smart contract extension is meant to be used with any ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT smart contract. It lets you create batches of 'delayed-reveal' NFTs.

'Delayed reveal' is a mechanism by which you can distribute NFTs to your audience and reveal the metadata of the distributed NFTs, after the fact. You can learn more how the delayed reveal NFTs work in [this blogpost](https://blog.thirdweb.com/delayed-reveal-nfts).

## Available functionality

| Functionality | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reveal`      | Lets an authorized wallet reveal a batch of delayed reveal NFTs. |

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

The `DelayedReveal` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contractâ€™s `DelayedReveal` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard for revealing the metadata of delayed-reveal NFTs on your NFT contract.
