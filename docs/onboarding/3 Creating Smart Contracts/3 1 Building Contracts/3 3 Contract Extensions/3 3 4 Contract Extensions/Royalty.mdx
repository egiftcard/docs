# Royalties

The `Royalty` smart contract is an extension usable with any base smart contract. It implements [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) NFT royalty standard for royalty support on NFT marketplaces.

The `Royalty` contract extension lets you set a _default_ recipient address for royalties generated by the secondary sales of your NFTs, and a _default_ percentage of secondary sales to take as royalties.

You can also override the royalty recipient and percentage for your NFTs on a per token ID basis.

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol";

contract MyContract is Royalty {

    /**
     *  We store the contract deployer's address only for the purposes of the example
     *  in the code comment below.
     *
     *  Doing this is not necessary to use the `Royalty` extension.
     */
    address public deployer;

    constructor() {
        deployer = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set royalty info for your NFT contract.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the contract deployer to set the royalty info.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `Royalty` extension.
     */
    function _canSetRoyaltyInfo() internal virtual override returns (bool){
        return msg.sender == deployer;
    }
}
```

## Unlocked Features

On the dashboard, you'll be able to set the wallet address and percentage of the royalty fee on secondary sales under the `Settings` tab:

Within the SDK, you can `get` and `set` the royalty fee (if you have the necessary permissions).
