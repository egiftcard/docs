# Royalties

The `Royalty` smart contract is an extension usable with any base smart contract. It implements [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) NFT royalty standard for royalty support on NFT marketplaces.

## Available functionality

| Functionality            | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `royaltyInfo`            | Returns the recipient of royalties and the % of sales to take as royalties, for a given NFT.                     |
| `getDefaultRoyaltyInfo`  | Returns the default recipient of royalties and the default % of sales to take as royalties, for any given NFT.   |
| `setDefaultRoyaltyInfo`  | Lets you set the default royalty recipient and % for your NFTs.                                                  |
| `getRoyaltyInfoForToken` | Returns the recipient of royalties and the % of sales to take as royalties, for an NFT of a particular token ID. |
| `setRoyaltyInfoForToken` | Lets you set the royalty recipient and % for an NFT of a particular tokenID.                                     |
| `_canSetRoyaltyInfo`     | Defines the criteria a wallet must meet to be able to set any royalty percentage and recipient.                  |

The `Royalty` contract extension lets you set a _default_ recipient address for royalties generated by the secondary sales of your NFTs, and a _default_ percentage of secondary sales to take as royalties.

You can also override the royalty recipient and percentage for your NFTs on a per token ID basis.

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol";

contract MyContract is Royalty {

    /**
     *  We store the contract deployer's address only for the purposes of the example
     *  in the code comment below.
     *
     *  Doing this is not necessary to use the `Royalty` extension.
     */
    address public deployer;

    constructor() {
        deployer = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set royalty info for your NFT contract.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the contract deployer to set the royalty info.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `Royalty` extension.
     */
    function _canSetRoyaltyInfo() internal virtual override returns (bool){
        return msg.sender == deployer;
    }
}
```

## Unlocked Features

The `Royalty` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contractâ€™s `Royalty` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to set royalty information for your NFT contract.
