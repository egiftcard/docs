# Contract Metadata

The `ContractMetadata` smart contract is an extension usable with any base smart contract. It lets you associate arbitrary metadata with your smart contract.

## Available functionality

| Functionality        | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contractURI`        | Returns the metadata associated with your smart contract.                           |
| `setContractURI`     | Lets an authorized wallet set the metadata for your smart contract.                 |
| `_canSetContractURI` | Defines the criteria a wallet must meet to be able to set your contract’s metadata. |

Using the `ContractMetadata` extension on your contract lets you to add information about your contract (image, description, etc). This information is stored in IPFS and linked to your contract using the standard `contractURI()` method made available on your smart contract.

For an ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT smart contract, storing royalty information using the `ContractMetadata` extension is necessary for royalty support on Opensea.

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/ContractMetadata.sol";

contract MyContract is ContractMetadata {

    /**
     *  We store the contract deployer's address only for the purposes of the example
     *  in the code comment below.
     *
     *  Doing this is not necessary to use the `ContractMetadata` extension.
     */
    address public deployer;

    constructor() {
        deployer = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set the metadata for your metadata.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the contract deployer to set the contract's metadata.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `ContractMetadata` extension.
     */
    function _canSetContractURI() internal virtual override returns (bool){
        return msg.sender == deployer;
    }
}
```

## Unlocked Features

The `ContractMetadata` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/ContractMetadata.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contract’s `ContractMetadata` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractmetadata).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to set the metadata of your smart contract.
