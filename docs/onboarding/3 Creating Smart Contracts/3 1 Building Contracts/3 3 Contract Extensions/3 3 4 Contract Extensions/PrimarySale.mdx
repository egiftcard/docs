## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

## Unlocked Features

The `PrimarySale` extension smart contract is open source, and is available [here on github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Royalty.sol).

Once deployed, you'll be able to access the following features from the dashboard and the SDK:

- You can interact with your smart contract’s `PrimarySale` features via the thirdweb SDKs. Read about the SDK API [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.contractroyalty).
- Deploy your contract with `thirdweb deploy` to get a UI on the dashboard to set primary sale information for your contract.
