# Base Contracts Overview

Base contracts provide sensible groups of functionality (contract extensions) "out of the box", enabling you to easily use them as the foundation of your smart contracts.

You can implement base contracts without implementing any functions, or you could modify some of the functionality by adding [overrides](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.0/contracts.html#inheritance).
