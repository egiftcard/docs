# ERC-721 Base Contract

The `ERC721Base` contract is for creating an NFT Collection that follows the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
"Non-Fungible Token" standard. It utilizes the [ERC-721A](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a) "Azuki" standard for gas optimizations when minting multiple NFTs at once,
along with several [contract extensions](/todo) common for NFT Collections outlined below.

## Available Functionality

Below is a table outlining what functionality is available in the `ERC721Base` contract.

| Functionality             | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Functions Available  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [ERC721A](/todo)          | Gas-optimized NFT Collection Base Contract.                                                                                                                                       | See [ERC721A](/todo) |
| [Mintable](/todo)         | Mint functionality (only callable by the owner, by default) with gas-optimized batch minting enabled by ERC721A functionality.                                                    | todo                 |

| [Ownable](/todo)          | Ownership of the contract for the contract deployer, and (1) the ability to transfer this ownership, and (2) restrict functions to be callable only by the owner of the contract. | todo                 |

## Implementing the Contract Extension

First, import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {} // Error: Contract "MyNFT" should be marked as abstract.
```

Add a constructor that configures the contract-level metadata when you deploy the contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {

	  constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        string memory _contractURI,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _contractURI,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {}

}
```

## Unlocked Features
