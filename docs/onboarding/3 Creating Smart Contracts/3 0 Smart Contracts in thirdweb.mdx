# Smart Contracts in thirdweb

Smart contracts are pieces of code that are stored and run on the blockchain.

thirdweb offers two ways to build and deploy smart contracts:

1. [Pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) that we provide for you that are already built and ready to deploy.
2. Your own contracts that we provide tools to help you build with [contract extensions](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions)
   and deploy with [thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy)

## Pre-built contracts

Pre-built contracts cover the most common use cases for smart contracts, such as:

- [Releasing an NFT Collection](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop)
- [Creating your own Token](/pre-built-contracts/token)
- [Building your own Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

Any contract you deploy with thirdweb is stored on the blockchain and **100% owned by you**.

<!-- TODO: This should be here, but currently it's on pre-built contracts Overview page.

### Proxy Contract Architecture

Pre-built contracts you deploy with thirdweb are "proxy" contracts, which reduce the gas cost of deploying smart contracts by **~90%** for you.

This works by having our smart contracts run the underlying logic, and you only deploy the code that is unique to your contract.
This is possible since all of the contracts deployed using our pre-built contracts run the same logic for things
like minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

For _example_, your contract stores knowledge of its metadata and state, such as its name, and what NFTs have been minted so far.
However, for any logic (such as minting an NFT), it delegates this to our underlying smart contract to handle.

Our contracts are [open source](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts) and also publicly visible on the blockchain;
so you can always check the code to see how it works.

## Your Own "Custom" Contracts

We recognize that not all web3 problems can be solved by one of our pre-built contracts,
which is why we built tooling to help you create and deploy your own contracts, and
**still get all the benefits of the thirdweb dashboard and SDKs!**

We have two tools to help you build and deploy your own smart contracts:

1. [Contract Extensions (Solidity SDK)](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions) enabling you to implement specific features to unlock full support for those features in the SDK and the dashboard.
2. [thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy) which allows you to deploy your own smart contracts using a CLI and the thirdweb dashboard (without any private keys)!
