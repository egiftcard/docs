# Signature Based Minting

Signature-based minting allows you to specify exactly what tokens can be minted into your smart contract.

**How it works**:

1. One wallet generates a signature for a token (specifying name, image, description, properties, and minter address).
2. Another wallet can use the signature to mint the NFT.

This allows you to grant signatures for specific wallets to mint tokens that have properties that you specify in your contract.

For example, you could grant a signature for a wallet to mint an NFT that contains their Discord profile picture,
and only grant a signature if that person is a member of your Discord server,
like we do in our [signature-based minting example](https://github.com/orgs/thirdweb-example/community-rewards).
