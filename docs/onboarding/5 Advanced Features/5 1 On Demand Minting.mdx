# On Demand Minting

On-demand minting (or "signature-based minting") allows you to specify which tokens can be minted into your smart contract.

## How it works:

1. **Wallet A** generates a signature for a token (specifying name, image, description, properties, and minter address).
2. **Wallet B** can use the signature provided by **Wallet A** to mint the NFT.

You can grant signatures for specific wallets to mint tokens with properties you specify in your contract.

For example, you could grant a signature for a wallet to mint an NFT that contains their Discord profile picture,
and only grant a signature if that person is a member of your Discord server,
like we do in our [on-demand minting example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/community-rewards).

## Smart Contract Design

Our [Signature Minting Design Doc](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/design/SignatureMint)
has a detailed explanation of how signature-based minting works and includes details of each parameter that can be configured.

On-demand minting is a way for a contract admin to authorize an external party's request to mint tokens on the admin's contract.

You can authorize some external party to mint tokens on your contract and specify what will be minted by that party.
