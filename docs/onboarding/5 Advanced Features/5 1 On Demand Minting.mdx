# On Demand Minting

On-demand minting (or "signature-based minting") allows you to specify exactly what tokens can be minted into your smart contract.

**How it works**:

1. One wallet generates a signature for a token (specifying name, image, description, properties, and minter address).
2. Another wallet can use the signature to mint the NFT.

This allows you to grant signatures for specific wallets to mint tokens that have properties that you specify in your contract.

For example, you could grant a signature for a wallet to mint an NFT that contains their Discord profile picture,
and only grant a signature if that person is a member of your Discord server,
like we do in our [signature-based minting example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/community-rewards).

## Smart Contract Design

Our [Signature Minting Design Doc](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/design/SignatureMint)
has a detailed explanation of how signature-based minting works and includes details of each parameter that can be configured.

In essence, on-demand minting is a way for a contract admin to authorize an external party's request to mint tokens on the admin's contract.

At a high level, this means you can authorize some external party to mint tokens on your contract, and specify what exactly will be minted by that external party.
