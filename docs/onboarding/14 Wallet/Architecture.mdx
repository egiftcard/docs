# Architecture

The Wallet SDK allows you to build a fully featured wallet solution
or integrate an existing wallet provider with thirdweb's
[Typescript](/wallet/usage-with-typescript-sdk),
[React](/wallet/usage-with-react-sdk),
[React Native](/wallet/usage-with-react-native-sdk), and
[Unity](/wallet/usage-with-unity-sdk) SDKs.
These SDKs provide everything you need to create web3 apps with ease.
