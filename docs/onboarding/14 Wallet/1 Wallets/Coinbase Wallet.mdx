Prompt users to connect [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) to your app

## Usage

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new CoinbaseWallet();

wallet.connect();
```

## Configuration

Optionally, provide a configuration object when instantiating the `CoinbaseWallet` class.

<details>
  <summary>chains (optional)</summary>
  <div>

Provide an array of chains you want to support.

Must be an array of `Chain` objects, from the [`@thirdweb-dev/chains`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/chains) package.

Defaults to our [default chains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#default-chains).

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Ethereum, Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const wallet = new CoinbaseWallet(
  // highlight-start
  {
    chains: [Ethereum, Polygon],
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>dappMetadata (optional) </summary>
  <div>

Information about your app that the wallet will display when your app tries to connect to it.

Must be an object containing `name`, `url` and optionally `description` and `logoUrl` properties.

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const walletWithOptions = new CoinbaseWallet({
  // highlight-start
  dappMetadata: {
    name: "thirdweb powered dApp",
    url: "https://thirdweb.com",
    description: "thirdweb powered dApp", // optional
    logoUrl: "https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico", // optional
  },
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>headlessMode (optional) </summary>
  <div>

This only applies when coinbase extension wallet is NOT installed on user's browser.

By default `headlessMode` is set to `false` - which means that when user does not have coinbase wallet extension installed, a QR Code scan modal will open when calling the `connect` method to allow the user to connect to their coinbase mobile app by scanning the QR code.

If headlessMode is set to `true` and coinbase wallet extension is not installed, the wallet will NOT open a QR Code scan modal - This is useful if you want to create a custom QR Code modal.

you can use the [getQrUrl](#getqrurl) method to get the QR Code url and create your own QR Code Modal

Must be a `boolean`.

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new CoinbaseWallet(
  // highlight-start
  {
    headlessMode: true,
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>walletStorage (optional) </summary>
  <div>

wallet needs to store data in persistent storage. By default it uses `localStorage` but if you want to use a different storage, you can provide your own storage using the `walletStorage` option.

Must be an object conforming to the `AsyncStorage` interface:

```typescript
export interface AsyncStorage {
  getItem(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  setItem(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  removeItem(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Example:

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new CoinbaseWallet(
  // highlight-start
  {
    walletStorage: {
      getItem: (key) => {
        // Implement your own storage logic here
      },
      removeItem: (key) => {
        // Implement your own storage logic here
      },
      setItem: (key, value) => {
        // Implement your own storage logic here
      },
    },
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

</div>
</details>
