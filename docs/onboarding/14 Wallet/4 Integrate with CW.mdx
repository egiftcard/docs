Once you have created a wallet class by following [this guide](/wallet/build-a-wallet), you can integrate it with [Connect Wallet](/react/react.connectwallet) button by creating a function that returns a `ConfiguredWallet` object and specifying it in [supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional)

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[
    myWallet(), // we will create this function in this guide
  ]}
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Create a function that returns `ConfiguredWallet`

```tsx
import { ConfiguredWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const myWallet = (config: MyWalletConfig) => {

  const configuredWallet: ConfiguredWallet = {
    id: "my-wallet",

    meta: {
      name: "My Wallet",
      iconURL: "https://...", // or ipfs://...

      // optional
      urls: {
        chrome: "https://...", // optional
        firefox: "https://...", // optional
        android: "https://...", // optional
        ios: "https://...", // optional
      },
    },

    create(options) {
      return new MyWallet({ ...options, ...config })
    }

    // optional
    connectUI(props) {
      return <MyWalletUI {...props} />;
    },

    // optional
    isInstalled() {
      // detect if your wallet extension is installed on user's browser/device
      return true; // or false
    },
  };

  return configuredWallet;
};
```

<details>
  <summary> config (optional) </summary>
  <div>

If your wallet requires some extra configuration for creating a wallet instance that is not provided from the `create` function's argument, you can expose it as `config` from `myWallet` function and merge the `options` and `config` to provide all the properties required by your wallet.

```ts
// if the options are not enough
const myWallet = (config) => {
  const configuredWallet: ConfiguredWallet = {
    create(options) {
      return new MyWallet({ ...options, ...config });
    },

    // ...
  };
  return configuredWallet;
};
```

If your wallet does not require any configuration, you don't need to include the `config`

```ts
// if the options are enough
const myWallet = () => {
  const configuredWallet: ConfiguredWallet = {
    create(options) {
      return new MyWallet(options);
    },

    // ...
  };
  return configuredWallet;
};
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> id </summary>
  <div>

A unique ID for your wallet that is used to identify your wallet among other wallets used in the app.

It can be anything, but using the name of your wallet as `id` is recommended as it
is not likely to be used by other wallets.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> meta </summary>
  <div>

metadata of your wallet.

### name and iconURL

`name` and `iconURL` are required. They are used to display your wallet in the list of supported wallets in Connect Wallet Modal

### urls

`urls` object is optional and all of its properties are optional as well.

```ts
{
  chrome?: string;
  firefox?: string;
  android?: string;
  ios?: string;
}
```

It is used to display a built-in "Get Started" screen. This screen renders UI for downloading the wallet's browser extension or iOS/Android app.

"Get started" screen's link is rendered below the list of supported wallets in ConnectWallet Modal - This link is only rendered if the first wallet in [supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) array) has the `urls` object in `meta`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> create </summary>
  <div>

A function that creates and returns the wallet instance.

### Type

```ts
import { WalletOptions } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { WalletInstance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

type Create = (options: WalletOptions) => WalletInstance;
```

You can create an instance of your wallet using the `options` provided by the `create` function and optionally use the `config` provided by the `myWallet` function.

```ts
create(options) {
  return new MyWallet({
    ...options,
    ...config,
  });
}
```

since the `create` method only provides `options` of type `WalletOptions` - the rest of the wallet-specific configuration (if any) can be exposed as `config` of the `myWallet` function.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> connectUI (optional) </summary>
  <div>

A function that returns a React component that renders the UI for connecting to your wallet.

This UI will be rendered inside the ConnectWallet Modal when the user clicks on your wallet in the list of supported wallets.

The `connectUI` function is given props of type `ConnectUIProps` which you can use in your UI to trigger various actions - like closing the modal, opening the modal, going back to the list of supported wallets etc.

### ConnectUIProps

```ts
{
   /**
   * close the connect wallet modal
   * @param reset -
   * - reset Connect Wallet Modal to initial state,
   * - so that if it's opened again, it will start from the wallet-selection screen
   * - default: `true`
   */
  close: (reset?: boolean) => void;

  /**
   * indicates whether the connect wallet modal is open or not
   */
  isOpen: boolean;

  /**
   * Open the connect wallet modal
   */
  open: () => void;

  /**
   * go back to the wallet selector screen in connect wallet modal
   */
  goBack: () => void;
};


```

### Headless Mode

If no `connectUI` is given, the wallet is assumed to be in "headless" mode - meaning that it does not require any UI to be rendered inside the ConnectWallet Modal to connect the wallet - This can be the case if either the wallet has its own UI that is appended to DOM or it does not require any UI at all.

In this case, when the user clicks on your wallet in the list of supported wallets, the `wallet.connect` method is called and the ConnectWallet Modal is closed.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> isInstalled (optional) </summary>
  <div>

A function that returns a boolean indicating whether your wallet is installed on the user's browser/device or not.

It is used to show an "installed" badge next to your wallet's name in the list of supported wallets in Connect Wallet Modal if this function is defined and returns `true`.

</div>
</details>

## Integrating with ConnectWallet

Once the above-shown function is created, you can specify it in the [supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop of [ThirdwebProvider](/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component.

Now your wallet will be available in the list of supported wallets in ConnectWallet Modal.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// render your app inside ThirdwebProvider
<ThirdwebProvider supportedWallets={[myWallet()]}>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```
