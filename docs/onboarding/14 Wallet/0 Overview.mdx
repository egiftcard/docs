# Wallet

Wallet is a [library](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/wallets) that enables you to integrate wallet connection capabilities into web3 applications.

It is usable as a standalone package to allow users to connect their wallets to your app,
and integrates with our [SDK](/sdk) to use the connected wallet
to interact with smart contracts, utilise [auth](/auth), [storage](/storage), and more.

It supports a vast array of the most popular browser wallets such as [MetaMask](/wallet/metamask),
[WalletConnect](/wallet/walletconnect) V1 and V2, [Coinbase Wallet](/wallet/coinbase-wallet), non-custodial wallets such as [Magic](/wallet/magic-link), multi-sig wallets such as [Safe (Gnosis)](/wallet/safe), 
and more; each with fine-grained control over the connection flow to create customized experiences,
or pre-built UI components to get you up and running quickly.
