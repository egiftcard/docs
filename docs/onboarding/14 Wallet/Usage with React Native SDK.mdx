# Usage with React Native SDK

thirdweb's [React Native SDK](/react-native) offers **100+ hooks** and **UI components** to build web3 apps with ease on **Any EVM-compatible blockchain**.

It allows you to Connect wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, and marketplaces; all with built-in caching, RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

When you want to use a wallet with React Native SDK - Instead of importing the wallet from `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` , you need to import its “wallet configurator” function from the `@thirdweb-dev/react-native` package.

This wallet configurator function contains additional metadata and UI for connecting the wallet which is shown in the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component's Modal.

You can find the list of all wallet configurators for React Native SDK [here](/react-native/wallets)

You can connect to a wallet in two ways:

1. using [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component for a prebuilt solution with UI
2. using [useConnect](/react/react.useconnect) hook to build a custom solution

## 1. Using ConectWallet

[ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component allows you to connect to wallets that are specified in [ThirdwebProvider](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional)

Clicking on the `ConnectWallet` button shows wallets in a Modal and shows wallet-specific UI for connecting the wallet when it is selected (This UI is defined in the wallet configurator itself, not in `ConnectWallet` component)

#### Example

```tsx
import {
  ThirdwebProvider,
  metamaskWallet,
  trustWallet,
  coinbaseWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

// provide supported wallets to ThirdwebProvider

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      supportedWallets={[metamaskWallet(), trustWallet(), coinbaseWallet()]}
      clientId="your-client-id"
    >
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

// render ConnectWallet button wherever you want

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 2. Using useConnect hook

[useConnect](/react/react.useconnect) hook allows you to programmatically connect to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useConnect, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const metamask = metamaskWallet();

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        const wallet = await connect(metamask, connectOptions);
        console.log("connected to ", wallet);
      }}
    >
      Connect to MetaMask
    </button>
  );
}
```

:::info

If you are building your own wallet and want to use it with React Native SDK
you will need to create a wallet configurator as mentioned in [Build a wallet guide](/wallet/build-a-wallet#3-integrate-with-connect-wallet-button)
where you can define a custom UI for connecting your wallet that will be shown in the ConnectWallet modal
