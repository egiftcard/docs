The `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package provides a set of pre-built components and functionality for creating and managing cryptocurrency wallets.

The following will guide you through how you can create your own wallet using the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package.

## Extending the `Connector` class

The [`Connector`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/interfaces/connector.ts) abstract class is the
interface between your wallet core functionality and the actual wallet class you'll use in your application.

## Methods

### connect

This method should trigger the connection flow of your wallet with the user's app.

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### args

The arguments needed to connect your wallet. This is specific to your wallet implementation which is why we leave it open for you to
add custom arguments here.

Returns a `string` containing the wallet address, or `undefined` if the connection failed.

```typescript
abstract connect(args?: ConnectParams<TConnectParams>): Promise<string>;

ConnectParams<TOpts extends Record<string, any> = {}> = {
  chainId?: number;
} & TOpts;
```

</div>
</details>

### disconnect

Disconnect the currently connected wallet from your app.

### getAddress

Returns a `Promise<string>` with the currently connected wallet address.

### getSigner

Returns a `Promise<Signer>` with the ethers signer associated with your wallet.

### getProvider

Returns a `Promise<providers.Provider>` with the ethers provider associated with your wallet.

### switchChain

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### chainId

The chain ID to switch to.

Must be a `number`.

</div>
</details>

### isConnected

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` indicating whether the wallet is connected or not.

### emit

Emit an event, with some optional data.

Note that the `Connector` extends the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` package. This way you can emit events from your wallet.

Some events worth mentioning are for example:

```javascript
wallet.emit("connect", {});
```

```javascript
wallet.emit("disconnect", {});
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### eventName

The name of the event to emit.

Must be one of: `change`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `error`, `message`, `open_wallet`, `request`.

#### data

Optional data to send with the event. Must be an object with information relevant to the event.

See [addListener](#addlistener) configuration for more information on the different events.

</div>
</details>

### setupListeners

This method should set all listeners needed for the wallet to work. It will be used by the `AbstractClientWallet` class to setup the listeners
when the wallet is connected.

### updateChains

Update the chains the wallet can connect to.

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### chains

The chains that are supported by the wallet. Defaults to our default chains.

Must be an array of `Chain` objects.

```typescript
type Chain = {
  chainId: number;
  chainName: string;
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: string;
    symbol: string;
    decimals: number;
  };
  rpcUrls: string[];
  blockExplorerUrls: string[];
};
```

</div>
</details>

## Extending the `AbstractClientWallet` class

The [`AbstractClientWallet`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/base.ts#L26) class is the base
class that provides an interface for interacting with your connector on one side and with applications on the other.

The main method that needs to be overridden is the `getConnector` method. This method should return a `Promise`
that resolves to a the [`Connector`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/interfaces/connector.ts#L6) class that you implemented.

## Methods

### getConnector

Returns a `Promise<Connector>` with the connector class that you implemented.

## Using your new wallet

At this point you should be able to instantiate your new wallet and calling `connect` on it.

```ts
const wallet = new MyWallet();
wallet.connect();
```
