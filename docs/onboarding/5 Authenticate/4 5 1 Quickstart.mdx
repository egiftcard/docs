Let's take a look at a quick example of how to use the authentication SDK to allow users on a frontend application to log in with just their wallets to a backend and make authenticated requests.

## Setup the Project

We'll start by cloning the [Thirdweb Auth Next](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/thirdweb-auth-next) example project using the [thirdweb CLI](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/thirdweb-cli)

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template thirdweb-auth-next
```

We also need to set up our backend with an admin private key (we'll explore what this means later).
To do this, we need to create a new file at the top level of our project called `.env.local` and add our private key to the file:

```
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning Private Key Best Practices

It is not secure to store your private key in an environment variable.

### Trying the Demo

To run the project locally, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see a page with just a connect wallet button (assuming your wallet isn't already connected to the page).

The first thing to do is to connect your MetaMask wallet to the page by clicking the `Connect Wallet` button.

:::tip Getting A Wallet

If you don't already have one, you can follow our guide on [creating a MetaMask wallet](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet)!

:::

Once you connect your wallet, the page should update to the following, and show you your wallet address in the `Your address` section.

![Login with Wallet](./assets/login-with-wallet.png)

## Why do we need authentication?

At this point, we've simply connected our wallet to the page, so the browser knows what our wallet address is.

What if a user wanted to make an API request to the back-end to access their sensitive account information?

We could restrict access based on their wallet address, but what if somebody else knew that address?
That person could then make an API request pretending to be the user, and get the account information, even if they didn't own the wallet; which would be a security risk!

We need to **prove** to the backend that we own the wallet address, rather than simply sending the wallet address.

Let's explore how this is possible with the authentication SDK.

### Generating an Authentication Token

We can prove that we are connected to a wallet to the backend by signing a specific login message with our private key,
which the backend will then use to verify that we do in fact own the address we claim to have.

You can do this step by clicking the `Login with Wallet` button, and you should be prompted to sign a message that looks something like the following (with different addresses, times, and nonce).

```
example.com wants you to sign in with your account:
0x9e1b8A86fFEE4a7175DAE4bDB1cC12d111Dcb3D6

Make sure that the requesting domain above matches the URL of the current website.

Nonce: f44b81a7-2547-40a4-8583-59f9be41e9f3
Expiration Time: 2022-07-06T15:22:54.829Z
```

Once you sign the message, it will get sent to the backend where the backend will verify your address and generate an authentication token to send to you.

:::tip

For those curious, you can actually see the authentication token by clicking `Inspect` > `Application` > `Cookies` and you'll see it under the `thirdweb_auth_token` cookie in this case.

:::

Now that you're logged in, your page should update to the following with the correct address in the `User` object displayed.

![User](./assets/login-user.png)

Our authentication token is now stored securely on the frontend, so if we make any future requests to the backend, the backend will still know the wallet address that we are logged in as.

You can try this out by clicking the `Get Secret` button, which makes a request to the backend for some secret content that can only be accessed by authenticated users. You should receive a secret back as below:

![Secret](./assets/login-secret.png)

Finally, if you try clicking the `Logout` button, the authentication token will be removed from the frontend, which means the `User` on the frontend should update to be empty again. Additionally, if you try clicking the `Get Secret` button, it will return you an unauthorized error.

So just like that, we have a **full login-flow where you can login to a backend with just a wallet!**

### Understanding the Code

Now that we've seen the basics of what this login flow can do, let's take a look at the important code to try to understand what's going on.

The first file we can take a look at is the `pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts` file, where we setup our entire authentication backend API.

```typescript
import { ThirdwebAuth } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/next";

// Configure thirdweb Auth with a private key and domain
export const { ThirdwebAuthHandler, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  privateKey: process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
  domain: "example.com",
});

// Export the thirdweb Auth API endpoints
export default ThirdwebAuthHandler();
```

Note that we are making use of the `@thirdweb-dev/auth` package.

Here, we configure thirdweb Auth, and export an API handler called the `ThirdwebAuthHandler` which automatically handles all requests to any `/api/auth` route. This will handle all login and logout requests, as well as requests to get the current user.

:::tip

This internally uses the `sdk.auth` interface from the `ThirdwebSDK` to handle wallet based login and logout.
To learn more about the details of this flow, you can checkout the [Advanced Usage](/auth/advanced-usage) section.

:::

Now that Auth is setup, we can take advantage of it in another endpoint. We can take a look at an example of this in this snippet from the `/pages/api/secret.ts` file:

```typescript
const user = await getUser(req);

if (!user) {
  return res.status(401).json({
    message: "Not authorized.",
  });
}
```

Here, we use the `getUser` function we exported from the previous file to obtain the user making a request. If there is an authenticated user (meaning that a JWT has been issued by our Auth API), then the `getUser` function will return the user data, and we can return the user some secret data. Otherwise, `user` will be `null` and we can reject them as unauthorized.

Next, we can take a look at the `/pages/_app.ts` file with the `ThirdwebProvider` configuration. In order to use Auth on the frontend, we need to set the `authConfig` object on the provider as follows:

```jsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  desiredChainId={activeChainId}
  authConfig={{
    domain: "example.com",
    authUrl: "/api/auth",
    loginRedirect: "/",
  }}
>
  <Component {...pageProps} />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

The configuration specifies the relative URL of our Auth API (which we setup at `/api/auth` in this case), the domain of our website (used to prevent phishing attacks), and the URL to redirect to after a successful login.

This allows us to use the `useLogin`, `useLogout`, and `useUser` react hooks throughout our frontend which will let us easily interact with our Auth API, as we can see in the `/pages/index.tsx` file:

```jsx
const login = useLogin();
const logout = useLogout();
const { user } = useUser();
```

```jsx
<button onClick={() => login()}>Login with Wallet</button>
<button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
<pre>User: {JSON.stringify(user || null)}</pre>
```

These functions let us easily make login and logout requests with just a single button click!

Just like that, we've setup user authentication with thirdweb Auth!
