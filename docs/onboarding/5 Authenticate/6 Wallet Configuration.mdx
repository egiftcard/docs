Auth makes use of a server-side wallet to sign and verify JWTs, as covered in the [how auth works section](/auth/how-auth-works/json-web-tokens). You can configure this wallet using a variety of wallet management options, giving you the freedom to choose the most convenient and secure setup for your project.

## Simple Wallets

The easiest way to get started with Auth would be to use a simple private key or signer wallet directly. It's easy to use such a setup with just the core `@thirdweb-dev/auth` package.

Given that private key and signer wallets for EVM and Solana depend on different packages underneath, they are accessible via separate `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` and `@thirdweb-dev/auth/solana` entrypoints, which each have their own `peerDependencies`.

### EVM

Use the following installation to get started with Auth using a simple EVM private key or signer wallet:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth ethers@5
```

**Private Key Wallet**

You can use an EVM private key (a 64 character hex-string) as your wallet by using the `PrivateKeyWallet` class from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` entrypoint.

:::warning

Never hardcode your private key into your codebase or commit it to version control! Instead, use an environment variable or other secure method to pass your private key in indirectly.

:::

```typescript
import { PrivateKeyWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";

// Pass private key from environment variables directly
const wallet = new PrivateKeyWallet(
  process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

**Signer Wallet**

You can also use any signer wallet compatible with the `ethers.Signer` interface, such as the `ethers.Wallet` class.

```typescript
import { SignerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Create a new ethers signer or use an existing one
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(...);
const wallet = new SignerWallet(signer);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

### Solana

Use the following installation to get started with Auth using a simple Solana private key or signer wallet:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth @noble/ed25519 @solana/web3.js bs58 tweetnacl
```

**Private Key Wallet**

You can use a Solana private key (a 64 character base58-string) as your wallet by using the `PrivateKeyWallet` class from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/solana` entrypoint.

:::warning

Never hardcode your private key into your codebase or commit it to version control! Instead, use an environment variable or other secure method to pass your private key in indirectly.

:::

```typescript
import { PrivateKeyWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/solana";

// Pass private key from environment variables directly
const wallet = new PrivateKeyWallet(
  process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

**Signer Wallet**

You can also use any Solana `Keypair` signer as your wallet.

```typescript
import { SignerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/solana";
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Get a solana keypair from somewhere
const keypair = Keypair.generate();
const wallet = new SignerWallet(keypair);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

## Advanced Wallets

For more advanced wallet setups like cloud wallets, managed private keys, and more, we have a variety of options available in our `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package. The package is an optional `peerDependency` of `@thirdweb-dev/auth`, so you'll need to install it separately, along with any peer depenencis of the specific wallet you want to use.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth @thirdweb-dev/wallets
```

For more information on the available wallets and the specific of their setup, see the [`@thirdweb-dev/wallets` documentation](/wallets)

</div>

For example, here's how you would use a signing key from AWS Secrets Manager as your Auth wallet using the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package (you would need to install its `@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager` peer dependency as well):

```typescript
import { AwsSecretsManagerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets/evm/wallets/aws-secrets-manager";

// Pass in your AWS configuration
const wallet = new AwsSecretsManagerWallet({
  secretName: "my-secret",
  secretKeyName: "private-key",
  awsConfig: {
    region: "us-east-1",
    credentials: {
      accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || "",
      secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || "",
    },
  },
});

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

## Custom Wallets

If none of the above methods are suitable for your project, you can also create your own custom wallet class by implementing the `GenericAuthWallet` interface from the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package for a completely custom setup.

Auth only requires the following simple wallet interface to facilitate signing and verification of JWTs:

```typescript
interface GenericAuthWallet {
  // Whether your wallet is an "evm" or "solana" wallet
  type: Ecosystem;
  // Get the address of your wallet
  getAddress(): Promise<string>;
  // Optionally get the chain ID of your wallet (important for EIP1271 wallets)
  getChainId?(): Promise<number>;
  // Sign a message with your wallet
  signMessage(message: string): Promise<string>;
  // Verify a signature
  verifySignature(
    message: string,
    signature: string,
    address: string,
  ): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

You can see how this interface is chain agnostic, and can be used across different blockchain ecosystems.

For example, here is a minimal implementation of the basic `SignerWallet` class from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` entrypoing, which follows the `GenericAuthWallet` interface:

```typescript
import type { Ecosystem, GenericAuthWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

class SignerWallet implements GenericAuthWallet {
  type: Ecosystem = "evm";
  #signer: ethers.Signer;

  constructor(signer: ethers.Signer) {
    this.#signer = signer;
  }

  public async getAddress(): Promise<string> {
    return this.#signer.getAddress();
  }

  public async signMessage(message: string): Promise<string> {
    return await this.#signer.signMessage(message);
  }

  public async verifySignature(
    message: string,
    signature: string,
    address: string,
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    const messageHash = ethers.utils.hashMessage(message);
    const messageHashBytes = ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash);
    const recoveredAddress = ethers.utils.recoverAddress(
      messageHashBytes,
      signature,
    );
    return recoveredAddress === address;
  }
}
```
