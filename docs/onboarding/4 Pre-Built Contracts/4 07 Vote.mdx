# Vote

The Vote contract is designed for groups such as DAO's to vote on proposals.

In order to use the Vote contract, you also need to have an existing ERC-20 token,
such as our [Token Contract](/pre-built-contracts/token) to act as the `governance token`.

You could use the Vote contract to:

- Vote to decide on organizational changes
- Vote on managing and distributing funds in a treasury
- Vote on any other proposal in an organization, such as a DAO
