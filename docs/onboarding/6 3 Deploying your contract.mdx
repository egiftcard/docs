# Deploy

Compile, upload, and deploy your smart contracts directly to the blockchain.

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

Using this command will:

- **Compile** all contracts it finds in the current directory.
- Allow you to select which contract(s) you want to deploy.
- Upload your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
- Open the deploy flow in the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for you to select one of
  our [supported networks](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use) to deploy to.

## Released Contracts

Deploy a contract that has been [released](/release) by passing the author and name of the contract in the form:

[`<author-address>/<contract-name>`](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/doubledev.eth/ERC4907)

```bash
# Contract Version is optional and defaults to the latest version.
npx thirdweb deploy --name doubledev.eth/ERC4907 --contract-version 1.0.0
```

## Prebuilt Contracts

Deploy one of our [prebuilt contracts](/pre-built-contracts) using the dashboard flow by running:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy --name --nft-drop
```
