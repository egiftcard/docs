## Using this template

This project demonstrates how to setup a wallet-based authentication flow compliant with the
[sign-in with ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) spec via the thirdweb SDK. It enables users to securely sign in to any backend service using just their wallet.

## Getting Started

This repository has multiple different examples showing how to implement this flow in different languages and backend frameworks.

**You can explore the setup and usage for each of these examples in the project specific folders:**

- [Login with Wallet Next](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/login-with-wallet/blob/main/login-with-wallet-next) - Uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/)) for both the frontend and backend.
- [Login with Wallet Next Fiber](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/login-with-wallet/blob/main/login-with-wallet-next-fiber) - Uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/)) for the frontend and a [Go Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) for the backend.
- [Login with Wallet Next Flask](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/login-with-wallet/blob/main/login-with-wallet-next-flask) - Uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/)) for the frontend and a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for the backend.
