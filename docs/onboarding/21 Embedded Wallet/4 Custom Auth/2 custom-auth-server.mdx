# Create a custom JWT auth server

Learn how to integrate your auth backend with our embedded wallets solution so you can onboard your users into web3 seamlessly. 

This guide will show you how to create your own Auth Server that is compatible with the `auth_endpoint` strategy. By doing so, you can have full control over user authentication and data security. This allows you to ensure that your application meets specific compliance requirements while also providing a customized sign-in experience.

:::caution
This guide is simplified for demonstration purposes and is not ready for production use. When modifying it for production, secure your endpoints and avoid hard-coding secrets or sensitive information. We recommend using environment variables and secret managers.

### **Integrate Embedded Wallets**

1. Navigate to Wallets > [Embedded Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded) in the thirdweb dashboard.
2. Create a thirdweb API key if you don't have one or select an existing key to use for this project. [Learn more about API keys.](https://portal.thirdweb.com/api-keys)

   ![Embedded wallet dashboard with create key displayed](../assets/ew-create-key.png)

3. Allowlist domain or bundle ids in Access Restrictions.
4. Navigate to the Configuration view and enable **Custom Auth Endpoint**

   ![Configuration view for embedded wallet](../assets/ew-configuration.png)

5. Set the Auth Endpoint URL to `https://embedded-wallet.thridweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/auth/test-custom-auth-endpoint`
6. Save the configuration.
7. Copy the client ID.
8. In your preferred thirdweb client SDK, pass the payload you retrieved from logging in to the server.

You can now auth into the wallet and use it to sign transactions like so (see [bring your own auth for more](/embedded-wallet/custom-auth)):

<TabItem value="react" label="React & React Native">

In React and React Native, the `useEmbeddedWallet()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```typescript
import { useEmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"; // or /react-native

const embeddedWallet = useEmbeddedWallet();

const handlePostLogin = async (jwt: string) => {
  await embeddedWallet.connect({
    strategy: "auth_endpoint",
    payload: JSON.stringify({ userId:"ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }),
  });
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Other Typescript Frameworks">

In other frameworks, use your own instance of the wallet to authenticate and connect.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet({
  chain: Goerli, //  chain to connect to
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Your thirdweb client ID
});

const authResult = await embeddedWallet.authenticate({
  strategy: "auth_endpoint",
  payload: JSON.stringify({ userId:"ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }),
});

const walletAddress = await embeddedWallet.connect({ authResult });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

A persistent, cross-platform wallet is now created for your user!

Of course, you would use your own auth server instead of the one we provided. The rest of this guide will show you how to create your own auth server.

### Setup

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your CLI

   ```bash
   mkdir custom-auth-server
   cd custom-auth-server
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js application

   ```bash
   npm init -y

   yarn init -y
   ```

3. Install the necessary packages

   ```bash
   npm install express jsonwebtoken
   ```

### **Create the Server:**

1. In the `custom-auth-server` directory, create a file at the root named `server.js` and paste the following:

   ```jsx
   const express = require("express");
   const fs = require("fs");

   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

   const users = [
     { id: 1, email: "user@example.com", password: "password123" },
   ];

   app.use(express.json());

   app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
     const { email, password } = req.body;
     const user = users.find(
       (u) => u.email === email && u.password === password,
     );
     if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

     res.send({ payload: user.id });
   });

   app.get("/thirdweb-will-call-this", (req, res) => {
     const { payload } = req.body;
     if (!payload) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });
     const user = users.find((u) => u.id === payload);
     if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });
     return res.send({
         userId: user.id,
         email: user.email,
         exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
      });
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

### **Test Locally**

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Test login:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

### **Deploy**

To deploy the server, you can use use services such as [Zeet](https://zeet.co/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### **Integrate Embedded Wallets**

1. Navigate to Wallets > [Embedded Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded) in the thirdweb dashboard.
2. Create a thirdweb API key if you don't have one or select an existing key to use for this project. [Learn more about API keys.](https://portal.thirdweb.com/api-keys)

   ![Embedded wallet dashboard with create key displayed](../assets/ew-create-key.png)

3. Allowlist domain or bundle ids in Access Restrictions.
4. Navigate to the Configuration view and enable **Custom Auth Endpoint**

   ![Configuration view for embedded wallet](../assets/ew-configuration.png)

5. Set the Auth Endpoint URL to `https://your-domain/thirdweb-will-call-this`
6. Set any additional headers that you would like to send to your server. For example, you can set the `Authorization` header to with a bearer token to authenticate the request coming to the auth endpoint.
7. Save the configuration.
8. Copy the client ID.
9. In your preferred thirdweb client SDK, pass the payload you retrieved from logging in to the server.

A persistent, cross-platform wallet is now created for your user.
