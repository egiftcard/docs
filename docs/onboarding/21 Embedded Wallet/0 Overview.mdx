# Embedded Wallet

Embedded Wallet is a simple yet powerful wallet that enables apps to create, manage, and control their users' wallets. Embedded Wallets are designed to onboard users with little to no web3 familiarity.
A user signs in with their email address or social account and is provided a functional wallet that your application manages. Afterward, they can purchase NFTs with credit cards, view and transfer NFTs, and send blockchain transactions.

## Features

- **Account Recovery:** Users can always access their wallets on other authenticated devices.
- **Modular, Composible & Customizable:** Email login, social login, and bring-your-own auth.
- **Enable Gasless Transactions:** When you combine embedded wallets with smart wallets, users do not require crypto to interact with the blockchain.
- **Security:** No single point of failure. Private keys cannot be reconstructed by thirdweb or any developer without user authentication. The only owner of the wallet is the end user.
- **Connect To Other Web3 Apps**: Your application's embedded wallet users can use the [My Wallets](https://ews.thirdweb.com/wallet) page to sign in to their wallet, and connect to web3 apps via WalletConnect.
- **View & Transfer NFTs**: Buyers can visit the [My Wallets](https://ews.thirdweb.com/wallet) page to view and transfer NFTs in their Embedded Wallets. We cover all gas fees related to transferring NFTs out of embedded wallets and offer a way for users to export their private keys.

## Use cases

- Creating user wallets without requiring web3/crypto knowledge or downloading an external app.
- Combining embedded wallets with smart wallets allowing users to send transactions e.g. trade and sell NFTs or ERC-20 tokens, gaslessly.
- Allowing users to access their wallets on different devices without additional passwords.
- Enabling users to connect to WalletConnect-compatible web3 apps. _OpenSea, CollabLand, etc._
