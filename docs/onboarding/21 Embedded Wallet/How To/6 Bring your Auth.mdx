By default, the embedded wallet service handles two things: auth, and spinning up crypto wallets tied to the auth. We require
valid authentication to ensure a wallet is created for the right person.
If you already have your own auth and only want to spin up wallets, we offer a simple way to hook up any **OpenID Connect ("OIDC") compatible** auth to create embedded wallets.

## How it works

- An OIDC auth system has a public-private keypair, where the private key is used to sign auth tokens
- The public key is uploaded to a public URL in JWKS format. The standard location is `https://{domain}.com/.well-known/jwks.json`
- When a user logs in, a JWT token called the idToken is generated and signed by the private key. The OIDC spec provides an interface for fields that are used in this token.
- We use the public key to verify that the JWT was signed correctly, and proceed to generate a wallet based on the `sub` (user identifier) value of the idToken.

## Configuration Setup

In your API key settings, click edit, look for "Custom Auth" and provide the following values:

- The URL of the JWKS file (public key)
  - This is used to verify the token was signed by you.
- The `aud` value of the idToken
  - This is used to verify that thirdweb is the intended user of the token

## Authenticating a user

Once you've logged in with your own auth, you can pass the user's JWT to the embedded wallet to authenticate and connect.

In React and React Native, the `useEmbeddedWallet()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```typescript
import { useEmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"; // or /react-native

const embeddedWallet = useEmbeddedWallet();

const handlePostLogin = async (jwt: string) => {
  await embeddedWallet.connect({
    strategy: "jwt",
    jwt,
  });
};
```

In other frameworks, use your own instance of the wallet to authenticate and connect.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet({
  chain: Goerli, //  chain to connect to
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Your thirdweb client ID
});

const authResult = await embeddedWallet.authenticate({
  strategy: "jwt",
  jwt,
});

const walletAddress = await embeddedWallet.connect({ authResult });
```
