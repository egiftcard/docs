# Welcome to thirdweb

## What is thirdweb?

thirdweb is a web3 application framework that enables you to easily build blockchain-based applications. With an intuitive dashboard, SDKs for the most popular languages, and audited contracts that you own and control, thirdweb offers a full suite of tools for teams to build and launch web3 apps to production with.

thirdweb enables developers to effortlessly transition their skills into the web3 development space by replacing the complexities of interacting with smart contracts with familiar languages and easy-to-use SDKs.

We offer tools to help you every step of the way, from creating your contracts on a test server to giving your users an optimized experience in production.

All of our tools aim to provide a seamless developer experience with built-in features including:

- Audited pre-built smart contracts for you to deploy on all the top blockchains.
- SDKs in popular languages you may be familiar with such as JavaScript, Python, and Go, so you don‚Äôt need to learn a new language like Solidity.
- Easily integrated and customizable UI components such as a Mint Button, NFT Renderer, and Connect Wallet button.
- UX Enhancements including our Fiat-on-Ramp and gasless transactions for frictionless user experiences.

thirdweb is used by tens of thousands of active builders and trusted by some of the world's top organizations in production. Not only that, we give you direct access to talk to our engineers and get detailed answers about all the quirks and nuances of your project in our Discord channel!

## How thirdweb Simplifies Web3 Development

Building web3 apps is hard, and the cost of mistakes can be extremely high.

Whether you're building a completely new web3 application or integrating web3 mechanics into you're existing app, there are many important details to consider:

- You need to be confident your smart contracts are safe from **exploits**.
- You need to account for a number of **web3 concepts**; like IPFS, RPCs, indexing, and connecting to your users' wallets.
- You may have to manage your team‚Äôs **access to resources** and configure payment structures or royalties.
- Your users expect seamless, **optimized** experiences and interactions they can trust.

**thirdweb** provides the solution to all of the above considerations and much more. We've created the ultimate web3 app framework to delight both the **developers** who use it and the **users** who interact with the apps built on top of it.

## How does thirdweb fit into the tech stack?

thirdweb has tools to enable and enhance your web3 application at every step in the development stack.

Let‚Äôs explore thirdweb‚Äôs three core offerings

1. Contracts
2. SDKs
3. The Dashboard

### Contracts

Smart Contracts are the bottom layer of your tech stack, they‚Äôre responsible for storing your applications data on the blockchain.

You can deploy one of our pre-built smart contracts onto a blockchain of your choice, or you could extend your custom-built contracts using thirdweb deploy to give you all of thirdweb's capabilities in your own contract.

Our pre-built contracts are audited by top-tier auditing firms such as Shipyard and 0xmacro to provide you with full confidence in their capabilities and safety. All of thirdweb‚Äôs contracts are open-source, meaning you can review these contracts yourself and explore the intricacies and details within them at any time.

Any contract deployed on thirdweb is 100% owned by you. Meaning if thirdweb ever disappears, your smart contracts are still administered by you on the blockchain. Not only that, it's around **10 times cheaper to deploy smart contracts with thirdweb** compared to deploying them yourself, using our proxy contracts. You can learn more about that [TODO LINK] here.

### SDKs

We provide SDKs to interact directly with your smart contracts in your favorite languages, including JavaScript, Python, Go, Unity, and C#.

thirdweb's SDKs connect your application to the blockchain, which allows you to easily read and write data to your smart contracts.

Within the SDK, we do all the heavy lifting, like connecting to the blockchain via RPC, configuring which networks you want to support, fetching data from IPFS, caching results from the blockchain, and much more.

In addition to the pre-built functionalities, we generate additional SDK capabilities dynamically if you're using a custom contract.

### Dashboard

thirdweb's dashboard is an easy-to-use admin tool where you can configure permissions, set platform and royalty fees, and share access to your contracts with your team members.

Our dashboard natively supports multi-sig wallets including Gnosis safe, making it perfect for teams and organizations to access and configure your smart contracts with.

The dashboard also enables you to configure and deploy any of thirdweb‚Äôs pre-built smart such as an NFT Collection, and perform basic functionalities such as minting without writing any code.

Within the dashboard, we provide simple code snippets for you to get started, and give you visual representations of what‚Äôs happening on your smart contract; like all the NFTs that have been minted in your collection, or what‚Äôs currently listed on your marketplace.

You can also perform common admin operations like burning your NFTs, removing listings from your marketplace, or deleting your smart contract completely. Within the dashboard, you‚Äôre able to manage your teams payments and distribute the funds that you‚Äôve received from within your smart contract with the click of a button.

**Getting Started**
