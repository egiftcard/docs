# Create

Create a new project with the language & framework of your choice and our SDKs pre-configured.

Answer a series of questions about your project, and have the CLI initialize a new project with your preferences setup.

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

## Contracts

Kickstart your Solidity smart contract development with [Extensions](/extensions) installed.

`create --contract` allows you to choose one of our [base contracts](/extensions) to start with,
(or a blank canvas), and have your Solidity development environment configured automatically.

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract
```

## Applications

Set up a new web application with the [React](/react) and [JavaScript](/javascript) SDKs set up.

Start with a basic configuration, or choose one of our [templates](/templates) to get a headstart.

```
