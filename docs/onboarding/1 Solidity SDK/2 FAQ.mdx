### What are the benefits of using Solidity SDK over writing my own Solidity contract from scratch?

Build allows you to inherit standardized interfaces, such as the ERC721 or ERC1155 standards, using our contract bases. This allows your contract to work well with other contracts that expect those standards, enabling interoperability. It also allows you to add custom functionality on top of the contract bases and extensions to unlock custom functionality for your application.
