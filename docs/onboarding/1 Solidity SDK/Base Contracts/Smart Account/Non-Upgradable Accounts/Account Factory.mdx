# Account Factory

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/non-upgradeable/AccountFactory.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) contract.

This factory smart contract is intended to be used to distribute ['Accounts`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) programmatically.

:::info

If you modify the [`Account`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) contract, it is recommended that you write your own
factory contract by inheriting from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) extension.

	  constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint

## Full Reference

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<details>
<summary>_initializeAccount</summary>
<div>

Called in `createAccount`. Initializes the account contract created in `createAccount`.

```solidity
function _initializeAccount(
    address _account,
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) internal override {
    Account(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

#### \_account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### \_admin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, abi encode the variables,
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument.

For example:

```solidity

function initializeAccount(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    Account.initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

</div>
</details>
