# Managed Account

<br />

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccount`](/solidity/extensions/base-account) contract.

Like [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account), the `ManagedAccount` smart wallet is an _upgradeable_ smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

The admin of the [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account-factory) contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccount` contracts that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart wallets to do so.

An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to **all** `ManagedAccount` smart wallets created by the factory. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate **pushing upgrades** to their users’ wallets.

#### Example Push Upgrade:

An app wants its user wallets to only be able to own NFTs within its ecosystem. This would be an upgrade to the smart wallet contract’s `onERC721Received` and `onERC1155Received` transfer hooks.

The app can enforce this behaviour by pushing this upgrade to its user wallets.

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account-factory) smart contract.

:::info

If you intend to issue accounts programmatically using a custom factory contract, you must do the following:

- Create a new factory contract by extending the [BaseAccountFactory](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) extension.

- Override the `_initializeAccount` function on the factory to create a new wallet. ([reference](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/smart-wallet/non-upgradeable/AccountFactory.sol#L36))

## Usage

Import the contract and inherit from it. This is an example contract demonstrating one way that you could override the functionality to create a token bound account.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/managed/ManagedAccount.sol";

contract ManagedTokenBoundAccount is ManagedAccount {
    constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint
    )
        ManagedAccount(
            _entrypoint
        )
    {}
}
```

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<details>
<summary>initialize</summary>
<div>

Initializes the smart contract wallet.

```solidity
function initialize(address _defaultAdmin, bytes calldata _data) public virtual initializer {
    factory = msg.sender;
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _defaultAdmin);
}
```

#### \_defaultAdmin

The account admin. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

The abi encoded data to initialize the contract with. Must be of type `bytes`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>getImplementationForFunction</summary>
<div>

Returns the extension implementation address, stored in the router, for the given function.

```solidity
function getImplementationForFunction(bytes4 _functionSelector) public view virtual override returns (address) {
    return Router(payable(factory)).getImplementationForFunction(_functionSelector);
}
```

#### \_functionSelector

The function selector to get the extension implementation address. Must be of type `bytes4`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>isValidSigner</summary>
<div>

Returns whether a signer is authorized to perform transactions using the wallet.

```solidity
function isValidSigner(address _signer) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, _signer) || _hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _signer);
}
```

#### \_signer

The signer to check authorization for. Must be of type `address`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>entryPoint</summary>
<div>

Returns the entry point contract address.

```solidity
function entryPoint() public view virtual override returns (IEntryPoint) {
    return entrypointContract;
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>_validateSignature</summary>
<div>

Validates the signature of a user operation.

```solidity
function _validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256 validationData)
{
    bytes32 hash = userOpHash.toEthSignedMessageHash();
    address signer = hash.recover(userOp.signature);

    if (!isValidSigner(signer)) return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED;
    return 0;
}
```

</div>
</details>
