All of thirdweb’s [smart wallets](/wallet/smart-wallet) are [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart contract wallets with role-based permission control.

Users can deploy a smart wallet for individual use, and app developers can issue smart wallets to their users programmatically.

thirdweb’s smart wallets have the following features by default:

- Have multiple owners
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

## Simple smart wallets

**[`Account.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) & [`AccountFactory.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/account-factory)**

The `Account` smart wallet is a simple smart wallet that comes with all the basic benefits of account abstraction, along with the mentioned default features.

App developers can issue [`Account`](<(/solidity/base-contracts/account)>) smart wallets programmatically by deploying an [`AccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/account-factory) smart contract.

The `Account` smart contract is _non-upgradeable_. Developers should use this wallet if they do not anticipate making any future upgrades to their users’ wallets.

## Dynamic Smart Wallets

**[`DynamicAccount.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) & [`DynamicAccountFactory.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account-factory)**

The difference between [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) smart wallet and [`Account`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) smart wallet is that `DynamicAccount` is an _upgradeable_ smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `DynamicAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a [`DynamicAccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account-factory) smart contract.

The admin of a given `DynamicAccount` smart wallet is allowed to make upgrades to their own smart wallets. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate providing _opt-in upgrades_ to their users’ wallets.

#### Example Use Case of Opt-In Upgrades:

A game with in-game NFT items wants to offer its players the ability to store their NFT items in a staking vault as soon as their wallets receive these NFTs. This would be an upgrade to the smart wallet contract’s `onERC721Received` and `onERC1155Received` transfer hooks.

The game can provide this upgrade as an opt-in upgrade to their players.

## Managed Smart Wallets

**[`ManagedAccount.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account) & [`ManagedAccountFactory.sol`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account-factory)**

Like [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account), the `ManagedAccount` smart wallet is an _upgradeable_ smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account-factory) smart contract.

The admin of the [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account-factory) contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccount` that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart wallets to do so. An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to _all_ `ManagedAccount` smart wallets created by the factory. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate _pushing upgrades_ to their users’ wallets.

#### Example use case of push upgrades:

An app wants its user wallets to only be able to own NFTs within its ecosystem. This would be an upgrade to the smart wallet contract’s `onERC721Received` and `onERC1155Received` transfer hooks.

The app can enforce this behaviour by pushing this upgrade to its user wallets.
