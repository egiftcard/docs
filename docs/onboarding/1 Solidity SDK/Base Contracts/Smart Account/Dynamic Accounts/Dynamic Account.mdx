# Dynamic Account

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/dynamic/DynamicAccount.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccount`](/solidity/extensions/base-account) contract.

The difference between `DynamicAccount` smart wallet and [`Account`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) smart wallet is that `DynamicAccount` is an _upgradeable_ smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

The admin of a given `DynamicAccount` smart wallet is allowed to make upgrades to their **own** smart wallets. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate providing **opt-in upgrades** to their users’ wallets.

#### Example Opt-in Upgrade:

A game with in-game NFT items wants to offer its players the ability to store their NFT items in a staking vault as soon as their wallets receive these NFTs. This would be an upgrade to the smart wallet contract’s `onERC721Received` and `onERC1155Received` transfer hooks.

The game can provide this upgrade as an opt-in upgrade to their players.

EIP4337 compliant dynamic smart account smart contract.

App developers can issue `DynamicAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a `DynamicAccountFactory` smart contract.

:::info

If you intend to issue accounts programmatically using a custom factory contract, you must do the following:

- Create a new factory contract by extending the [BaseAccountFactory](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) extension.

- Override the `_initializeAccount` function on the factory to create a new wallet. ([reference](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/smart-wallet/non-upgradeable/AccountFactory.sol#L36))

## Usage

Import the contract and inherit from it. This is an example contract demonstrating one way that you could override the functionality to create a token bound account.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/dynamic/DynamicAccount.sol";

contract DynamicTokenBoundAccount is DynamicAccount {
    constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint,
        address _defaultExtension
    )
        DynamicAccount(
            _entrypoint,
            _defaultExtension
        )
    {}
 }
```

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<details>
<summary>initialize</summary>
<div>

Initializes the contract with the provided roles.

```solidity
function initialize(address _defaultAdmin, bytes calldata) public virtual override initializer {
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _defaultAdmin);
    _setupRole(EXTENSION_ADMIN_ROLE, _defaultAdmin);
}
```

#### \_defaultAdmin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, override this function, abi encode the variables,
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument and then abi-decoded in this function to be set in storage.

For example:

```solidity

function initialize(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    super.initialize(_admin);
    (chainId, tokenContract, tokenId) = abi.decode(
        _data,
        (uint256, address, uint256)
    );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>entryPoint</summary>
<div>

Returns the entry point contract address.

```solidity
function entryPoint() public view virtual override returns (IEntryPoint) {
    return entrypointContract;
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>getImplementationForFunction</summary>
<div>

Returns the extension implementation address stored in router, for the given function.

```solidity
function getImplementationForFunction(bytes4 _functionSelector) public view virtual override returns (address) {
    address impl = getExtensionForFunction(_functionSelector).implementation;
    return impl != address(0) ? impl : defaultExtension;
}
```

#### \_functionSelector

The function selector to get the extension implementation address. Must be of type `bytes4`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>isValidSigner</summary>
<div>

Returns whether a signer is authorized to perform transactions using the wallet.

```solidity
function isValidSigner(address _signer) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, _signer) || _hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _signer);
}
```

#### \_signer

The signer to check authorization for. Must be of type `address`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>_canSetExtension</summary>
<div>

Returns whether a extension can be set in the given execution context.

```solidity
function _canSetExtension() internal view virtual override returns (bool) {
    return _hasRole(EXTENSION_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>_validateSignature</summary>
<div>

Validates the signature of a user operation.

```solidity
function _validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256 validationData)
{
    bytes32 hash = userOpHash.toEthSignedMessageHash();
    address signer = hash.recover(userOp.signature);

    if (!isValidSigner(signer)) return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED;
    return 0;
}
```

</div>
</details>
