# Dynamic Account Factory

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/dynamic/DynamicAccount.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) contract.

This factory smart contract is intended to be used to distribute ['DynamicAccounts`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) programmatically.

:::info

If you modify the [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) contract, it is recommended that you write your own
factory contract by inheriting from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) extension.

:::

## Usage

Use the [CLI](/cli) [`create`](/cli/create) command to create a `DynamicAccountFactory` smart contract:

```bash
npx thirdweb create contract
```

[Deploy](/deploy) your contract using the deploy cli command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

Or import the contract into your existing project and inherit from it.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/dynamic/DynamicAccountFactory.sol";

contract MyDynamicAccountFactory is DynamicAccountFactory {
	  constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint
    )
        DynamicAccountFactory(
            _entrypoint
        )
    {}
}
```

## Full Reference

<details>
<summary></summary>
<div>

Called in `createAccount`. Initializes the account contract created in `createAccount`.

```solidity
    function _initializeAccount(
        address _account,
        address _admin,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal override {
        DynamicAccount(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
    }
```

#### _account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### _admin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### _data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, override this function, abi encode the variables, 
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument. 

For example:

```solidity

function initializeAccount(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    DynamicAccount(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

#### _account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### _admin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### _data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, abi encode the variables, 
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument. 

For example:

```solidity

function initializeAccount(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    DynamicAccount.initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```
