# Ownable

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Ownable.sol";
```

The `Ownable` smart contract extension is usable with any base smart contract. It lets you set an owner for your smart contract.

## Usage

The `Ownable` extension is an _abstract contract_, and expects you to implement the following functions by yourself:

| Name                                                        | Type                    | Returns | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`_canSetOwner`](/solidity/extensions/ownable#_cansetowner) | internal view _virtual_ | `bool`  | Runs on every attempt to set the owner of the contract. Returns whether the owner can be set in the given execution context. |

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

<details>
<summary>owner</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function owner() public view override returns (address);
```

- Returns the owner of the contract.
- Set this value using the `setOwner` function.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>setOwner</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function setOwner(address _newOwner) external;
```

- Lets an authorized wallet set a new owner for the contract. This value can be read from the `owner` function.
- Parameter `_newOwner`: The address to make the owner of the contract.
- The `_canSetOwner` function is run on every call to this function. If the return value of `_canSetOwner` is `false`, the `setOwner` call will revert.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>_setupOwner</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function _setupOwner(address _newOwner) internal;
```

- Sets the owner of the smart contract. This value can be read from the `owner` function.
- Parameter `_newOwner`: The address to make the owner of the contract.
- The `_canSetOwner` function is _not_ run on a call to this function.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>_canSetOwner</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function _canSetOwner() internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

- Runs on every `setOwner` function call.
- Returns whether a new owner can be set in the given execution context.
- For example, this function can check whether the wallet calling `setOwner` is the contract owner, and enforce that only the current owner should be able to successfully call `setOwner`.
