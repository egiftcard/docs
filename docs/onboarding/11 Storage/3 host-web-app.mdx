# Host Web App

Uploading an app to decentralized storage offers perks such as reliable data, resistance to censorship, and better user data control. It is also more secure, scalable, and globally accessible.

Deploy a web app to decentralized storage (IPFS) using the CLI.

**Prerequisites**

- configure clientId through `<ThirdwebProvider>` in your app
- login to the thirdweb CLI using your clientId and SecretKey

## Using Starter Templates

[Starter templates](https://thirdweb.com/templates) are already pre-configured and set up for IPFS deployments.

To deploy an app to IPFS from a starter template:

1. Run the following command at the root of your project's directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Upon executing this script, the application will be constructed, and subsequently, the contents of the `dist` output directory will be uploaded to IPFS.

2. Once deployed successfully, the CLI will return the corresponding deployed URI and Gateway link.

## Upload in Your Existing App

To deploy to IPFS using your existing app, we will highlight the fields needed in your configuration files before running `deploy` in the following frameworks: React, Next, and Vite

### Upload a React App to IPFS

To deploy your app to IPFS in React:

1. Navigate to your `package.json` file in your project
2. Add a `homepage` field and set it to `"."`

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "homepage": ".",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. In the same file, add the following `deploy` script.

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "deploy": "yarn build && npx thirdweb@latest upload build"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands at the root directory of your project:

   ```json
   npm run deploy
   ```

   or

   ```json
   yarn deploy
   ```

5. Once deployed successfully, the CLI will return the corresponding deployed URI and Gateway link.

### Upload a Next app to IPFS

To deploy your app to IPFS from Next:

1. Navigate to the `package.json` file in your project.
2. Add the following `deploy` script

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "deploy": "yarn build && npx thirdweb@latest upload build"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands at the root directory of your project to run the script:

   ```json
   npm run deploy
   ```

   or

   ```json
   yarn deploy
   ```

4. Once deployed successfully, the CLI will return the corresponding deployed URI and Gateway link.

### Upload a Vite app to IPFS

To deploy your app to IPFS from Vite:

1. Navigate to the `vite.config.js`
2. Set the `base` field in your `defaultConfig` to `./`

   ```json
   const defaultConfig = {
     base: "./",
     plugins: [react()],
   };
   ```

3. Navigate to your `package.json` file and add the following deploy script

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "deploy": "yarn build && npx thirdweb@latest upload dist"
     }
   }
   ```

   When running this script, your application will be built, and the output directory `dist` will be uploaded to IPFS, effectively deploying your application.

4. Depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands at the root directory of your project to run the script:

   ```json
   npm run deploy
   ```

   or

   ```json
   yarn deploy
   ```

5. Once deployed successfully, the CLI will return the corresponding deployed URI and Gateway link.
