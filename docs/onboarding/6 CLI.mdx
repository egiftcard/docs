Create, build and deploy your smart contracts and apps with our interactive command line interface.

To see all of the available commands, run the following:

```bash
npx thirdweb

## Create

Create a new project with thirdweb installed and configured.

Select the frameworks you know and love to get started quickly, by providing:

- A name for your project
- A framework to build with
- A language to write in

#### Command

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

#### Options
- --app: (`boolean`) Create a web3 app.
- --contract (`boolean`): Create a web3 contract project
- --ts, --typescript (`boolean`): Initialize as a TypeScript project.
- --js, --javascript (`boolean`): Initialize as a JavaScript project.
- --forge (`boolean`): Initialize as a Forge project.
- --hardhat (`boolean`): Initialize as a Hardhat project.
- --extension (`boolean`): Create a smart contract extension.
- --cra (`boolean`): Initialize as a Create React App project.
- --next (`boolean`): Initialize as a Next.js project.
- --vite (`boolean`): Initialize as a Vite project.
- --reactNative (`boolean`): Initialize as a React Native project.
- --express (`boolean`): Initialize as a Express project.
- --node (`boolean`): Initialize as a Node project.
- --use-npm (`boolean`): Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using npm.
- --use-pnpm (`boolean`): Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using pnpm.
- --framework (`string`): The preferred framework.
- --solana (`boolean`): Initialize as a Solana project.
- --evm (`boolean`): Initialize as an Ethereum project.
- --template (`string`): A template to start your project from. You can use an template repository name from the official thirdweb-example org.
- --contract-name (`string`): Name of the new smart contract to create

## Install
Install thirdweb into your project. If no path is specified, the current directory will be used.

#### Command
```bash
npx thirdweb install [path to project]
```

#### Options
- --nightly (`boolean`): Install the nightly version of packages.
- --dev (`boolean`): Install the dev version of packages

## Build
Compile your smart contracts and detect any [extensions](/solidity/extensions) you have implemented. This command:
- Detects the framework you're using
- Compiles all of your smart contracts
- Prints out the [extensions](/solidity/extensions) you have implemented for each contract

#### Command
```bash
npx thirdweb build
```

#### Options
- -p, --path (`string`): Path to project
- -d, --debug (`boolean`): Show debug logs
- -a, --all (`boolean`): Run detection on all contracts

## Deploy

[Deploy](/deploy) your smart contracts to one of our [supported networks](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use/) using the dashboard:

- Compiles your smart contracts
- Uploads the contract [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html)s to IPFS
- Allows you to [deploy](/deploy) them through the dashboard

#### Command
```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

#### Options
- -p, --path (`string`): Path to project
- --dry-run (`boolean`): Dry run (skip actually publishing)
- -d, --debug (`boolean`): Show debug logs
- --ci (`boolean`): Continuous Integration mode
- --dist-path (`string`): Path to the dist folder where the HTML based App is
- -n, --name (`string`): Name of the pre-built or published contract (such as nft-drop)
- -f, --file (`string`): Filter for contract files that contain this file name
- -cn, --contract-name (`string`): Filter for contracts that contain this contract name
- -cv, --contract-version (`string`): Version of the published contract
- --app (`boolean`): Deploy a web app to decentralized storage
- --contract (`boolean`): Deploy a smart contract to blockchains
- --dynamic (`boolean`): Deploy a dynamic smart contract made up of extensions to blockchains

## Publish

[Publishes](/publish) a versioned release of your contract onto our registry:

- Compiles your smart contracts
- Uploads the contract [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html)s to IPFS
- Allows you to [publish](/publish) them through the dashboard

#### Command
```bash
npx thirdweb publish
```

#### Options
- -p, --path (`string`): Path to project
- -f, --file (`string`): Filter for contract files that contain this file name
- -cn, --contract-name (`string`): Filter for contracts that contain this contract name
- --dry-run (`boolean`): Dry run (skip actually publishing)
- -d, --debug (`boolean`): Show debug logs
- --ci (`boolean`): Continuous Integration mode

## Additional commands

program
