# How it works

To read data from IPFS, you need an [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/). This allows you to access data from the IPFS protocol on browsers and other HTTP clients, such as when building an application using the Contract [SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdks).

When a user requests data from the network, the request is sent to the gateway. The gateway then retrieves the data from the decentralized storage network and returns it to the user.

For developers, Gateway reduces the complexity of decentralized file management which requires fetching from multiple IPFS gateways.`
