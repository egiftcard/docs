import CodeSnippetWithSummary from "@components/CodeSnippetWithSummary";

Read data and make transactions on your contract from the connected wallet.

## Read Contract Data

Use the name of the function, view, or mapping, and provide any required arguments.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"SmartContract"}
  name={"call"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
  snippetOverrides={{
    react: `const { contract } = useContract(\"{{contract_address}}\");\nconst { data, isLoading, error } = useContractData(contract, \"functionName\", ...args);`,
  }}
/>

## Write Transactions

Transactions are made using the connected wallet (or the wallet you instantiated the SDK with).

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"SmartContract"}
  name={"call"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>
