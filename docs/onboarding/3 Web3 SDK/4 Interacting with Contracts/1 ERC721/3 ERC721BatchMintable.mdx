# ERC721 - Batch Mint NFTs

## Mint Many unique NFTs

Provide an array of metadata objects to mint many unique NFTs in a single transaction to a single recipient.

:::info Gas Usage

This method does not provide any significant gas savings over minting each NFT individually.

If you are looking to batch upload and then have other wallets mint the NFTs, see [ERC721 - Lazy Minting](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721lazymintable).
