# ERC1155 - Mint NFTs

## Mint an NFT with a limited supply

Provide a metadata object to mint a specified quantity of a new NFT.

This function automatically uploads and [pins](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/securing-pinning-your-nft-with-ipfs/) your metadata to IPFS.

If you _already_ have your metadata uploaded to IPFS (or any URL that points to valid metadata),
you can directly pass the `URI` as the second argument; rather than a metadata object.
