# Getting a Contract

The SDK is capable of getting **any** smart contract deployed to one of our [supported blockchains](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use).

When you deploy one of our [prebuilt contracts](/pre-built-contracts), or your contract implements a [contract extension](/extensions),
you unlock specific features of the SDK that help you interact with your contract and its functions more easily.

## Get Any Contract Instance

Using the React SDK's [useContract](/react/react.usecontract) hook
or the TypeScript SDK's [getContract](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.getcontract) method,
you can get an instance of any custom contract using its contract address.

<!-- TODO: Create code snippet for this + more react  -->

**React:**

```jsx
const { contract } = useContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

<!-- TODO: Create code snippet for this + more react  -->

**TypeScript:**

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

## Get Contract From ABI

If you have compiled your Solidity code into an [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#contract-abi-specification),
you use this value to get a contract instance.
