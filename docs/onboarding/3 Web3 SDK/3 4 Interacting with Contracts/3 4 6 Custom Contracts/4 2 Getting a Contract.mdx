# Getting a Contract

The SDK is capable of getting **any** smart contract deployed to one of our [supported blockchains](/guides/which-network-should-you-use).

When you deploy one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts), or your contract implements a [contract extension](/extensions),
you unlock specific features of the SDK that help you interact with your contract and it's functions more easily.

## Get Any Contract Instance

Using the React SDK's [useContract](/react/react.usecontract) hook
or the TypeScript SDK's [getContract](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.getcontract) method,
you can get an instance of any custom contract using it's contract address.

<!-- TODO: Create code snippet for this + more react  -->

**React:**

```jsx
const { contract } = useContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

<!-- TODO: Create code snippet for this + more react  -->

**TypeScript:**

```javascript
const contract = sdk.getContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

## Getting Specific Contracts

If your contract is a [pre-built](/pre-built-contracts) contract, or implements [extensions](/extensions),
you can get a **typed** instance of the contract with specialized functions.

Use the resources below to learn more about the specific contracts you can get.
