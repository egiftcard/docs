title: Switching Networks

In most Web3 Applications, you want your user to be connected to the same network that the contract is deployed on.

## Declaring Your Desired Chain

Using the [React](/react) SDK, you first declare your "desired" chain for users in the `ThirdwebProvider`:

```jsx
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Here, we set our desired chain to be "Mainnet" (Ethereum)
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={ChainId.Mainnet}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

## Detecting Incorrect Chain Connection

Now you can detect when users are connected to the wrong network using the `useNetworkMismatch` hook:

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Component = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch();

  return <div>{isMismatched}</div>;
};
```

## Switching Networks

If you need to request users to change networks, you can use the `useNetwork` hook:

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch, useNetwork, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Here, we show a button to the user if they are connected to the wrong network
// When they click the button, they will be prompted to switch to the desired chain
const Component = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch();
  const [, switchNetwork] = useNetwork();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{isMismatched}</p>
      {isMismatched && (
        <button onClick={() => switchNetwork(ChainId.Mainnet)}>
          Switch Network
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Accessing Current Chain ID

Alternatively, you can also access the [chain ID](/typescript/sdk.chainid#chainid-enum) of the network the current wallet is connected to using `useChainId`:

```jsx
import { useChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Component = () => {
  const chainId = useChainId();

  return <div>{chainId}</div>;
};
```

## Example

Below is an example where you listen for when the user connects their wallet, and then immediately ask them to switch to the desired chain.

```jsx
import {
  ChainId,
  useNetworkMismatch,
  useNetwork,
  useChainId,
  useMetamask,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Component = () => {
  const address = useAddress(); // Get connected wallet address
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask(); // Connect wallet with Metamask
  const [, switchNetwork] = useNetwork(); // Switch to desired chain
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch(); // Detect if user is connected to the wrong network

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the user is connected to the wrong network
    if (isMismatched) {
      // Prompt their MetaMask wallet to switch networks
      switchNetwork(ChainId.Mainnet); // the chain you want here
    }
  }, [address]); // This above block gets run every time "address" changes (e.g. when the user connects)

  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <h4>Connected as {address}</h4>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
