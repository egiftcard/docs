# Backend & Scripting Applications

Back-end applications are suitable for when you need to perform actions from _**your**_ wallet or simply need to **read** data,
rather than connecting to your user's wallets.

You can build back-end applications or scripts by using any of our SDKs:

  languages={["JavaScript", "Python", "Go", "Unity"]}
/>

## Installation

<InstallingThirdwebCodeTabs />

## Instantiating the SDK

There are two different kinds of SDK instances you can create:

1. **Read-only**: Select a network and connect to it to read data from the blockchain.
2. **Read-Write**: Connect a wallet using either a [private key](#from-a-private-key) or [signer/provider](#from-a-signer--provider) and write transactions directly from the wallet.

### Read-only Connection

Provide the name of the chain you want to connect to as a string.

<InitializingThirdwebCodeTabs />

### From a Private key

This instantiates the SDK with write permissions directly from a wallet's private key.

If you expose your private key, anyone can access your wallet's funds. Please proceed carefully.

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- Check if you need to use a private key for your application.
- **Never** directly expose your private key in your source code.
- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.
- **Never** use a private key for a frontend (website/dapp) application.

If you are unsure how to securely store and access your private key, please do not proceed.

### From a Signer / Provider

You can use a signer such as one from an
[Ethers Web3Provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v4/cookbook-providers.html) to instantiate the SDK.

## Configuring Chain

If you are using one of our <code>default chains</code>, provide the name of the chain as a string.

For non-default chains, import one of the 700+ chains available in the
[`@thirdweb-dev/chains`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/chains) package.

You can install this package with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/chains
```

Then, import the chain you want to use and pass it as the argument, rather than a string.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
// highlight-next-line
import { Gnosis } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  // Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  "<your-private-key-here>",
  // highlight-next-line
  Gnosis,
);
```

### Custom Chains

If your chain is not included in the `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package,
you can provide the chain information yourself as an object.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
  // Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  "<your-private-key-here>",
  {
    // === Required information for connecting to the network === \\
    chainId: 59140, // Chain ID of the network
    // Array of RPC URLs to use
    rpc: ["<your-rpc-url-here>"],

    // === Information for adding the network to your wallet (how it will appear for first time users) === \\
    // Information about the chains native currency (i.e. the currency that is used to pay for gas)
    nativeCurrency: {
      decimals: 18,
      name: "Consensys ETH",
      symbol: "crETH",
    },
    shortName: "czkevm", // Display value shown in the wallet UI
    slug: "consensys", // Display value shown in the wallet UI
    testnet: true, // Boolean indicating whether the chain is a testnet or mainnet
    chain: "ConsenSys", // Name of the network
    name: "ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet", // Name of the network
  },
);
```

### Local Nodes

If you are running a local node using a tool such as
[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview) or
[Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/anvil/README.md), provide `"localhost"` as the name.

You can then deploy or import your contracts to the [dashboard](/dashboard) to interact with them in your app.
