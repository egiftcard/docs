# Permission Controls

Permissions outline which wallet addresses can perform which actions on your smart contract.

To define which wallets have these permissions, you must add them to the required role.

Each contract has a different set of configurable roles, you can find the full list in the [ALL_ROLES](/typescript/sdk.all_roles#all_roles-variable) variable.

| Role Name | Description                                                                  | Relevant Contracts                                                             |

This will overwrite all existing permissions on this contract.

**THIS INCLUDES YOUR OWN WALLET ADDRESS**.

If you revoke your admin permissions, you will not be able to get them back.

Only proceed if you know what you are doing.

### Update Roles

1. Read the current roles from the `get` function.
2. Modify the array for the role you want to update.
3. Call the `setAll` function with the modified array.

```javascript
const rolesAndMembers = await contract.roles.getAll();

const updatedRoles = {
  ...rolesAndMembers,
  admin: [...rolesAndMembers.admin, "0x-new-address-here"],
};

await contract.roles.setAll(updatedRoles);
```
