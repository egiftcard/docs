title: Enable Gasless Transactions

import QuickstartCard from "@components/QuickstartCard";

By combining [Smart Wallet](/smart-wallet) and [Embedded Wallet](/embedded-wallet), you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless transactions
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery for both the embedded wallet “key” and the smart wallet
- Web2 login experience using email or social.

Let’s create an app that creates smart wallets for our users.

These smart wallets will require a **“personal wallet”** to access and initialize the wallet. For this personal wallet, we will of course use an embedded wallet.

From the user's perspective, they will log in with their email or social account. Under the hood, an embedded wallet is created for them, and then a smart wallet is created and initialized using the embedded wallet.

## Source Code

View the full source code on GitHub:

<div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Source Code"
    link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/embedded-smart-wallet"
    image="/assets/github-icon.webp"
  />
</div>

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/smart-accounts).

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 12, padding: 8, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Managed Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Dynamic Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DynamicAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## 2. Install Dependencies

To use smart wallets with embedded wallets in a React app you can either:

- Use the [create](/cli/create) command to create a new project with the dependencies already installed.
- Add the dependencies to an existing project.

### Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

When prompted, select/input the following options:

- A name for the project
- `EVM` as the blockchain
- Select your desired environment e.g. `Next.js`
- `TypeScript` or `JavaScript` as the language.

This will create a repository.

### Add Dependencies to an Existing Project

To add the dependencies to an existing project, run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
npx thirdweb install
```

This will detect the environment you are working in and install the relevant dependencies.

## 3. Add Connect Wallet Component

The easiest way to add embedded wallets and smart wallets to your app is using the `Connect Wallet` component:

```jsx
import {
  ThirdwebProvider,
  ConnectWallet,
  embeddedWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      activeChain="mumbai"
      clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
      supportedWallets={[
        smartWallet(embeddedWallet(), {
          factoryAddress: "YOUR_FACTORY_ADDRESS",
          gasless: true,
        }),
      ]}
    >
      <ConnectWallet />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

This will create an embedded wallet and a smart wallet for the user. The smart wallet will be initialized with the embedded wallet.
The user will then see the Connect Button which, when clicked, will show the user a modal to connect/create their wallet:

When the user connects a wallet by entering their email, they will be able to view & interact with their smart wallet:
