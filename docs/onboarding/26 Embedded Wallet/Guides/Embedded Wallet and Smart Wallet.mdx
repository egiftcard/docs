title: Enable Gasless Transactions with a Web2 User Experience
---

By combining Smart Wallet and Embedded Wallet, you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless Transactions
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery for both the embedded wallet “key” and the smart wallet
- Web2 login experience using email or social.

Let’s create an app that creates smart wallets for our users. These smart wallets will require a “personal wallet” to access and initialize the wallet. For this personal wallet, we will of course use an embedded wallet. From the user's perspective, they will log in with their email or social account. Under the hood, an embedded wallet is created for them, and then a smart wallet is created and initialized using the embedded wallet.
