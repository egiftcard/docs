## Prompt login with a prebuilt modal (Recommended)

Open a prebuilt modal to prompt the user to sign in with email or social login.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet();
await embeddedWallet.connect();
```

If the user is already logged in, this modal is skipped and the method returns.

This method throws an exception if the user closes the modal.

## Prompt email one-time passcode (OTP) modal (Advanced)

If the user's email is already known, email them a one-time passcode emailed and prompt them to verify it.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

// regular flow with prestyled modal that directly prompts for email otp
const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet();
await embeddedWallet.connect({
  loginType: "ui_email_otp",
  email: "user@example.com",
});
```

If the user is already logged in, this modal is skipped and the method returns.

## Login with Google with your own UX (Advanced)

Headless method for login with Google.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet();
// headless login with google
const googleWindow = window.open("", "Login", "width=350, height=500");
if (!googleWindow) {
  throw new Error("Failed to open google login window");
}

// make sure to call this after a user event - button click etc.
await embeddedWallet.connect({
  loginType: "headless_google_oauth",
  // the following are not strictly required but highly recommended
  // mainly to prevent bowser from blocking pop-ups
  openedWindow: googleWindow,
  closeOpenedWindow: (openedWindow) => {
    openedWindow.close();
  },
});
```
