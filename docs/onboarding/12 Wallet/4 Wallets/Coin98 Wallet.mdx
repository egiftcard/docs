import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Prompt users to connect to their [Coin98 wallet](https://coin98.com/).

## Usage

```javascript
import { Coin98Wallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new Coin98Wallet();

wallet.connect();
```

## Configuration

Optionally, provide a configuration object when instantiating the `Coin98Wallet` class.

<details>
  <summary>projectId (recommended) </summary>
  <div>

This is only relevant if you want to use [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) for connecting to Coin98 wallet mobile app when MetaMask is not injected.

This `projectId` can be obtained at [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). It is highly recommended to use your own project id and only use the default one for testing purposes.

```javascript
import { Coin98Wallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new Coin98Wallet(
  // highlight-start
  {
    projectId: "YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID",
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>recommended (optional) </summary>
  <div>

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the [ConnectWallet Modal](/react/react.connectwallet).

```ts
Coin98Wallet({
  // highlight-start
  recommended: true,
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>
