import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Prompt users to connect to their [Core wallet](https://core.app).

## Usage

```javascript
import { CoreWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new CoreWallet();

wallet.connect();
```

## Configuration

Optionally, provide a configuration object when instantiating the `CoreWallet` class.

<details>
  <summary>projectId (recommended) </summary>
  <div>

This is only relevant if you want to use [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) for connecting to Core wallet mobile app when MetaMask is not injected.

This `projectId` can be obtained at [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). It is highly recommended to use your own project id and only use the default one for testing purposes.

```javascript
import { CoreWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new CoreWallet(
  // highlight-start
  {
    projectId: "YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID",
  },
  // highlight-end
);
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>recommended (optional) </summary>
  <div>

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the [ConnectWallet Modal](/react/react.connectwallet).

```ts
CoreWallet({
  // highlight-start
  recommended: true,
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

## Methods

Inherits all the public methods from the [`AbstractClientWallet`](interfaces/abstract-client-wallet) class.
