The Connect Wallet component and the Wallet SDK allow you to create and connect wallets to your app.
It allows you to easily integrate existing wallet providers with thirdweb's
[Typescript](/wallet/usage-with-typescript-sdk),
[React](/wallet/usage-with-react-sdk),
[React Native](/wallet/usage-with-react-native-sdk), and
[Unity](/wallet/usage-with-unity-sdk) SDKs or [create your own custom wallet connectors](/connect/build-a-wallet).

If you are working in [React](/react), [React Native](/react-native), or [Unity](/unity), you can use the `ConnectWallet` component to
connect & create wallets. The [`ConnectWallet`](/connect/connect-wallet) component is a pre-built component that uses the Wallet SDK
under the hood. If you'd like to connect wallets in a back-end environment, or if you'd like full control of how
wallets are created or handled, you can use the Wallet SDK directly.

## Connect Wallet Component

If you are in a [React](/wallet/usage-with-react-sdk), [React Native](/wallet/usage-with-react-native-sdk), or [Unity](/wallet/usage-with-unity) environment, you can use the `ConnectWallet` component to connect & create wallets.
This component is a pre-built component that uses the Wallet SDK under the hood and works out of the box!

`ConnectWallet` has a customizable UI and allows you to connect to any of the supported wallets in the Wallet SDK. Read the [`ConnectWallet`](/react/react.connectwallet) documentation to learn more.

## SDK Hooks and Functions

The React, React Native, Unity, TypeScript and Wallet SDKs all include functionality that enables you to perform actions such as connecting, disconnecting and funding wallets.
This gives you finer-grained control over how wallets are handled in your app.

You would use these hooks and functions in the following scenarios:

1. You want to create your own Connect Wallet user interface.
2. You want to use a wallet instance directly in your app. Examples include disconnecting a wallet or getting the signer from a wallet.

## Using the Wallet SDK Directly

You can use the Wallet SDK directly in any environment that supports TypeScript. The Connect Wallet component is built using the Wallet SDK.
The Wallet SDK enables you to connect and create wallets which you can then use in your app to sign transactions as you usually would.
There are two main instances in which you would use the Wallet SDK directly:

1. Connecting wallets in a back-end environment such as Node.js script to sign transactions without passing a private key.
   Instead, a browser popup would be initiated to sign the transaction.

2. In projects where you need low-level control of the wallet

- Example: Needing to pass custom configuration options such as specifying a custom `execute` method for `smartWallet` e.g. [in this template](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/unilogin/tree/main).
