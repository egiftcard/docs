title: Customize Supported Tokens

Customize the tokens shown in the "Send Funds" screen for various networks.

By default, The "Send Funds" screen shows a few popular tokens for default chains and the native token. For other chains it only shows the native token.


```jsx
import { Base } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

// Show "Dai Stablecoin" when connected to the "Base" mainnet
<ConnectWallet
  supportedTokens={{
    // use chain id of the network as key and pass an array of tokens to show
    // you can directly pass the number or import the chain object from @thirdweb-dev/chains to get the chain id
    [Base.chainId]: [
      {
        address: "0x50c5725949A6F0c72E6C4a641F24049A917DB0Cb", // token contract address
        name: "Dai Stablecoin",
        symbol: "DAI",
        icon: "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9956/small/Badge_Dai.png?1687143508",
      },
    ],
  }}
/>
