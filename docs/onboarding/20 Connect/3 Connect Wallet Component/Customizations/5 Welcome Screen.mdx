title: Welcome Screen (wide screen)
---

On wide modal, a welcome screen is shown on the right side of the modal. Use this space to show your branding or even build intersting functionality.

This screen can be customized in two ways

#### 1. Preset metadata

```tsx
<ConnectWallet
  welcomeScreen={{
    title: "Your Title",
    subtitle: "Your Subtitle",
    img: {
      src: "https://...",
      width: 300,
      height: 50,
    },
  }}
/>
```

#### 2. Render your own component

```tsx
<ConnectWallet
  welcomeScreen={() => {
    return <YourComponent />;
  }}
/>
```
