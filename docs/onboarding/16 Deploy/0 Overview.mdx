# Deploy

Easily deploy **any** contract to **any EVM** compatible chain, no setup needed, using a single command:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

## Why Use Deploy

Benefits of using Deploy:

- No setup or installation is needed
- Increased security:
     - No need to export a private key. The deployment is done from the [dashboard](/dashboard) UI from your browser, using a browser wallet.
     - Support for [Safe](https://safe.global/wallet) so no need to share private keys across your team.
- No need to set an RPC URL - we handle all the complexities for you!
- Deploy using a user interface. This allows you to set the constructor arguments at the time of deployment.
- Automatically uploads and pins the contract metadata (ABI) to IPFS.
- Automatically adds your contract to the [dashboard](/dashboard) - this step is [gasless](/glossary/gasless-transactions)! This means you can easily manage and interact with your contract.
