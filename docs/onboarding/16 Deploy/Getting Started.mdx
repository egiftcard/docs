# Deploy

Use the [CLI](/cli) to deploy your contracts directly to **Any EVM compatible chain** using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

## Usage

Running this command will:

- **Compile** all the contracts in the current directory.
- Allow you to select which contract(s) you want to deploy.
- Upload your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
- Detect the [extensions](/solidity/extensions) on your contract.
- Open the deploy flow in the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for you to connect a wallet, input the contract parameters
and select a chain to deploy to.

```bash
npx thirdweb [options]
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.deploy.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
```
