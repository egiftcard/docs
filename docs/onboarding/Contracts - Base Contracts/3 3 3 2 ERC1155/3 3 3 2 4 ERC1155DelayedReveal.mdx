# ERC1155DelayedReveal

The `ERC1155DelayedReveal` smart contract uses the [ERC1155LazyMint](/extensions/base-contracts/erc-1155/erc1155lazymint) base contract along with the `DelayedReveal`contract extension.

'Delayed reveal' is a mechanism by which you can distribute NFTs to your audience and reveal the metadata of the distributed NFTs, after the fact.

You can read more about how the `DelayedReveal` extension works, [here](https://blog.thirdweb.com/delayed-reveal-nfts).
