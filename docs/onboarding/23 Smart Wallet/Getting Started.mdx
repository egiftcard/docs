Use the following code to integrate smart wallets into your apps. This will handle:

- Connecting your users to their smart wallet based of their personal wallet (can be any wallet, including email or local wallets).
- Automatically deploy the individual account contracts for your users when they do their first onchain transaction.
- Handle all transaction gas costs via the thirdweb paymaster.
- Select your deployed account factory and client ID to get a fully functional code snippet.

## Requirements

The following setup is needed to add ERC-4337 smart wallet support to your application:

### 1. Smart Wallet Factory Contract

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/smart-accounts).

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

|                    | [`Account`](/solidity/base-contracts/account) setup                                                                                     | [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) setup                                                                                                           | [`ManagedAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/managed-account) setup                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Upgradeability** | Non-upgradeable                                                                                                                         | Account upgrades controlled locally by account admin.                                                                                                                        | Account upgrades controlled centrally by account factory admin.                                                                                                                               |
| **User persona**   | Developer wants to issue simple smart wallets to their users. They do not anticipate that users wallets will need any feature upgrades. | Developer wants to issue smart wallets to their users. They do anticipate feature upgrades to user wallets but do not want to push upgrades to user wallets without consent. | Developer wants to issue smart wallets to their users. They do anticipate feature upgrades to user wallets, and want to push upgrades to user wallets for seamless/invisible UX for upgrades. |

### 2. An API key

:::info
You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services such as the bundler and paymaster.

The API key will need to have the following settings:

- smart wallet as an enabled service
- The contracts that the smart wallet will interact with must be added to the "Destination Contracts" list. Learn more [here](/api-keys#smart-wallet-allowed-destination-addresses)

:::

Obtain an API key from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

The API key lets you access thirdweb's bundler and paymaster infrastructure, which is required for the smart wallet to operate and optionally enable [gasless transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions).

Learn more about creating an API key and restricting which contracts the smart wallet can interact with [here](/api-keys).
