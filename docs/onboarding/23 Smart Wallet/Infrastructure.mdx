# Bundler & Paymaster Infrastructure

The thirdweb SDK handles all the heavy lifting of bundling operations and covering gas fees with a turn key infrastructure.

On testnets, the only requirement is to obtain a free client id to get started.
Once you're ready to deploy on mainnets, you will require an active [billing account](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings).
You can configure your client id to restrict interactions only with your own contracts or with any contract.

### Using a Custom Bundler & Paymaster

Smart Wallet is free to use with your own account abstraction infrastructure. To use your own paymaster & bundler,
pass the `bundlerUrl`, `paymasterUrl` and `paymasterAPI` options to the `SmartWallet`:

```javascript
class MyPaymaster extends PaymasterAPI {
  async getPaymasterAndData(
    userOp: Partial<UserOperationStruct>,
  ): Promise<string> {
    // your implementation, must return the signed paymaster data
  }
}

const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain,
  gasless,
  factoryAddress,
  clientId,
  bundlerUrl: "your-bundler-url",
  paymasterUrl: "your-paymaster-url",
  paymasterAPI: new MyPaymaster(),
};
```
