# Using Smart Wallet in React

By using the [wallet SDK](/wallet/smart-wallet) alongside the [React SDK](/react), you can use smart wallets in your front-end applications easily.

In react, there are three ways to get started with smart wallets:

- Using the [`ConnectWallet`](#using-connectwallet) component - an out of the box UI to connect your users with any wallet including smart wallet.
- Using the [`useConnect` hook](#using-useconnect) to create a custom UI.
- Using the [`Wallet SDK`](#using-thirdwebsdkprovider) directly for low level control over the smart wallet.

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/smart-accounts).

Choose the right smart wallet setup for your app. thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of smart wallets:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 12, padding: 8, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Managed Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Dynamic Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DynamicAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## 2. Create an API key

To use the smart wallet bundler and paymaster you need to create an API key and a billing account.

To create an API Key:

- Head to the settings page in the dashboard and click the **API Keys** tab.
- Click on **Create API Key**:

![Create API Key](/assets/dashboard/settings-tab.png)

- Give your API key a name and click **Next**.
- Make sure that the **Smart Wallets** services are enabled and any addresses that your deployed smart accounts interact with are added to the **Allowed Contract Addresses** section:

![Create API Key](/assets/dashboard/create-api-key-combined.png)

- Click **Next** and then ignore the **Set Access Restrictions** section. If you are using the smart wallet as part of a client side application,
  you will need to add the domains/ bundle IDs of your application here but since we will be writing a script, we do not need this. Click "Create" to create your key.
- Copy your **Secret Key** and store it in a safe place such as a password manager. You will not be able to see this key again.
- Click **I Have Stored the Secret Key Securely** and your key will now be visible from the API Keys table.
- **Note**: to edit your private key at any point, click on the key from the table and then click on the **Edit** button.

To use smart wallets on mainnet you will also need to [create an account and add a paymet method](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/billing).

## 3. Create an App

To use smart wallets in a react app you can either:

- Use the [create](/cli/create) command to create a new project with the dependencies already installed.
- Add the dependencies to an existing project.

### Create a new project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

When promted, select/input the following options:

- A name for the project
- `EVM` as the blockchain
- Select your desired environment e.g. `Next.js`
- `TypeScript` or `JavaScript` as the language.

This will create a repository.

### Add dependencies to an existing project

To add the dependencies to an existing project, run the following commands:

```bash
npx thirdweb install
```

This will install the relevant dependencies.

## 1. Using ConnectWallet

To use the pre-built UI component to connect your users to your app using smart wallet,
we need to pass a `smartWallet` as a `supportedWallet` to the `ThirdwebProvider`.

First, let's set up our configuration for the smart wallet. In `main.tsx` add the following:

```tsx
export const smartWalletConfig = smartWallet({
  factoryAddress: "your-factory-address",
  gasless: true,
  personalWallets: [localWallet()],
});
```

You can change the configuration based on your requirements,
but for this demo, we will enable gasless transactions and use a local wallet as the personal wallet.
You can learn more about the configuration [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.smartwallet).

Pass the configuration to the provider:

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  clientId="<your-client-id>"
  activeChain={activeChain}
  supportedWallets={[smartWalletConfig]}
>
  <App />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

Now, import the `ConnectWallet` component from the React package and add it to your app:

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ConnectWallet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Since we already added Smart Wallet as a supported wallet, it will automatically be used in the `ConnectWallet` component to connect users to your app.
Clicking on the connect button will show a popup:

![Connect Wallet](../assets/connect-wallet.png)

You can now create a new wallet with a password or import a previously created wallet. This will create a smart wallet for you and connect it to the application

![Connected Smart Wallet](../assets/connected-smart-wallet-react.png)

## 2. Using useConnect

[useConnect](/react/react.useconnect) hook allows you to programmatically connect to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useConnect, smartWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export const smartWalletConfig = smartWallet({
  factoryAddress: "0x6B1F8bBF4Af9267C0a483Da53BaE1118eadC50C1",
  gasless: true,
  personalWallets: [localWallet()],
});

function App() {
  const connect = useConnect();
  const personalWallet = new LocalWallet({
    chain: "goerli",
  });
  await personalWallet.loadOrCreate({
    strategy: "encryptedJson",
    password: password,
  });

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        const wallet = await connect(smartWalletConfig, {
          personalWallet: personalWallet,
        });
        console.log("connected to ", wallet);
      }}
    >
      Connect to MetaMask
    </button>
  );
}
```

## 3. Using ThirdwebSDKProvider

`ThirdwebSDKProvider` is a lower-level provider that accepts an arbitrary wallet and only handles contract interaction. This means you can use the Wallet SDK to programmatically connect to any wallet, and pass the connected wallet to this provider to execute transactions from the connected wallet.

To use this method, you will need to install the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebSDKProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { SmartWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { Signer } from "ethers";

function MyComponent() {
  const [signer, setSigner] = useState<Signer | null>(null);

  const config: WalletOptions<SmartWalletConfig> = {
    chain: "goerli", // the chain where your smart wallet will be or is deployed
    factoryAddress: "<your-factory-address>", // your own deployed account factory address
    clientId: "<your-client-id>", // obtained from the thirdweb dashboard
    gasless: true,
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const generateWallet = async () => {
      const personalWallet = new LocalWallet({
        chain: "goerli",
      });
      await personalWallet.loadOrCreate({
        strategy: "encryptedJson",
        password: password,
      });
      const smartWallet = new SmartWallet(config);
      await smartWallet.connect({
        personalWallet: personalWallet,
      });
      setSigner(await smartWallet.getSigner());
      console.log("signer", signer);
    };
    generateWallet();
  }, []);

  // The provider will handle maintaining the connected wallet
  // calling contracts from within the provider with the regular hooks
  // will execute on behalf of the provided wallet signer
  return (
    <ThirdwebSDKProvider
      activeChain={Goerli}
      signer={signer}
      clientId="your-client-id"
    >
      <App />
    </ThirdwebSDKProvider>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how to connect users to a React app using two methods:

- With a pre-built UI component.
- With a custom UI component.
- Low-level control with ThirdwebSDKProvider and the Wallet SDK.
