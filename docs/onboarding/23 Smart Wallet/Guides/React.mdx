# Using Smart Wallet in React

By using the [wallet SDK](/wallet/smart-wallet) alongside the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript), you can use smart wallets in your applications easily.

In react, there are two ways to get started with smart wallets:

- Using the [`ConnectWallet`](#using-connectwallet) component - an out of the box UI to connect your users with any wallet including smart wallet.
- Using the [`useConnect` hook](#using-usewallet) to create a custom UI.
