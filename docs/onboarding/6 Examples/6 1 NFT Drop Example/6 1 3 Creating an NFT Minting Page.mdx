# Creating an NFT Minting Page

We have created a template for you to simply plug in your NFT Drop contract address and have your NFT minting page created for you!

The information such as image, name, description, and supply are all automatically loaded from your NFT Drop contract.

:::info

In this section, we assume you have some knowledge of how to `clone` a git repository,
and have Node JS installed on your machine.
:::

## 1. Clone the NFT Minting Page Template

You can create your own copy of this [template repository](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/custom-minting-page)
by using `git clone`, or downloading the repository as a `.zip` file and unzipping it from the GitHub url.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdweb-example/custom-minting-page
```

Once you have the code on your computer, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

To start running the code locally, run the command below.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

## 2. Configure the NFT Drop Contract Address

Replace the value of the `myNftDropContractAddress` inside the `index.tsx` file
with your NFT Drop contract address; you can find this in the dashboard.

```jsx
// Put Your NFT Drop Contract address from the dashboard here
const myNftDropContractAddress = "<your-address-here>";
```

## 3. Configure the Network your NFT Drop Contract is deployed on

In our example repository, we enforce users to be on the `Matic Mumbai` test network.

If you are on a different network, you'll need to configure this value in two places.

1. Inside the `_app.tsx` page, replace the value of `activeChainId` to the chain ID of your network.

```jsx
// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai; // This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
```

2. Inside the `index.tsx` page, inside the `mint` function, replace the value inside the `switchNetwork` function to match the chain ID of your network.

```jsx
// Function to mint/claim an NFT
async function mint() {
  // ...

  if (isOnWrongNetwork) {
    // Change this value (ChainId.Mumbai) to match your chain.
    switchNetwork && switchNetwork(ChainId.Mumbai);
    return;
  }
```

## 4. Configure the Styles to Match Your brand

You can fully customize the colors and style of this template by editing the `.css` files inside the `/styles` directory.

That's it! You're ready to ship your NFT minting page to your community.
