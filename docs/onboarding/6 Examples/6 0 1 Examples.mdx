# Examples

The easiest way to create **web applications** is by using `create-tw-app`.

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

This interactive CLI creates a new app with the language & framework of your choice and thirdweb pre-configured.

You can also start with one of our [example projects](/examples) by passing the `--example` flag and the name of the repository.

```bash
# This clones our NFT minting page example project.
npx thirdweb create --example custom-minting-page
```

Our most popular examples are:

- [custom-minting-page](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/custom-minting-page): An NFT minting page with a claim button and remaining supply
- [nft-gated-website](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/nft-gated-website): A website where content is only accessible to users who hold an NFT
- [signature-based-minting](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/signature-based-minting): Server-side signature-based minting on an NFT Collection with Next.js
