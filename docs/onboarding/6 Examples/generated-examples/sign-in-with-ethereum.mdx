# Sign In With Ethereum

Authenticate to a backend using a wallet

To create a new project using this template, use the [thirdweb CLI](/thirdweb-deploy/thirdweb-cli):

```jsx
npx thirdweb create --template sign-in-with-ethereum
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    gap: "2%",
    marginBottom: 32,
    width: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginTop: 16,
  }}
>
  <ViewCodeButton
    link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/sign-in-with-ethereum"
    name="sign-in-with-ethereum"
  />
</div>

## Using this template

This project demonstrates an example flow for setting up an authentication flow using the
[sign-in with ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) spec via the thirdweb SDK.

It implements a backend endpoint with an admin wallet to generate and verify signatures as a form of authentication, and a react frontend to enable a user on the client side to connect and authenticate with their wallet.

## Setup

To run the project, first clone this repository, and then run one of the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Next, you need to create a `.env.local` file and add the `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` variable to it with the private key of the wallet you want to use as the admin wallet to generate and verify payloads. Your file should use something like the following:

```.env
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

Finally, you can run the project with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to visit the client side page where you can connect a wallet, sign-in with ethereum and view the payload, and use the payload to authenticate with the backend.
