## Using this template

First, intall the required dependencies:

```

Then, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `pages/index.tsx`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
