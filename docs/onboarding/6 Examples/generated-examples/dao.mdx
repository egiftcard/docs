# DAO

Build a DAO using thirdweb's vote, token, and edition drop contracts.

To create a new project using this template, use the [thirdweb CLI](/thirdweb-deploy/thirdweb-cli):

```jsx
npx thirdweb create --template dao
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    gap: "2%",
    marginBottom: 32,
    width: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginTop: 16,
  }}
>
  <DemoButton link="https://dao.thirdweb-example.com" name="dao" />
  <ViewCodeButton link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/dao" name="dao" />
</div>

## Using this template

This is the repository for the Buildspace x thirdweb course on "Build your own DAO with just Javascript in a weekend"!

You can find the course here: https://buildspace.so/p/build-dao-with-javascript

## Tools

- [Vote Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/vote): To orchestrate votes and view proposals for members of the DAO, using the governance token created in the token contract.

- [Token Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/token): To act as the governance token for the DAO, which is required to participate in the voting process.

- [Edition Drop Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop): To mint NFTs for the DAO using the same asset (i.e. a membership card NFT)

## Using This Repo
