# Using the Example Repo

It's important to note that there are two kinds of listings on the Marketplace:

1. Direct listings
2. Auction listings

You can learn more about the difference on the [**Creating Listings**](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace#creating-listings)
section on the Marketplace contract documentation.

## Cloning the Marketplace Example Repository

We've created an example repository where you can **create**, **view**, **bid on**, and **buy** listings.

You can create your copy of this [template repository](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/marketplace-next-ts)
by using `git clone`, or downloading the repository as a `.zip` file and unzipping it from the GitHub URL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdweb-example/marketplace-next-ts.git
```

Once you have the code on your computer, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

To start running the code locally, run the command below.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

## Configure your Marketplace Contract Address

Replace the value of the contract address inside all of the `useMarketplace` hooks
with your Marketplace contract address; you can find this address in the dashboard.

## Configure the Network

In our example repository, we enforce users to be on the `Rinkeby` test network.

If you are on a different network, you'll need to configure this value inside the `_app.tsx` file.

```jsx
// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Rinkeby;
```

## Configure the Styles

You can configure any of the styles inside the `/styles` directory to change the look and feel of the
application to match your brand.
