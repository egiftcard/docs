# Token Gated Membership

In this example, you'll learn how to create a website that restricts content based on the ownership of an NFT.

You can use either an [NFT Collection](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection),
[NFT Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop),
[Edition](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition),
or
[Edition Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop)
to create your NFTs.

For this example, we'll use an [Edition Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop).
The NFTs in this Drop will use the same asset with the [ERC1155 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155),
so that every owner has a "membership card" NFT.

We'll show you how to:

- Create your NFTs using thirdweb
- Create an application that connects to your NFT smart contract
- Restrict content based on ownership of an NFT

## Demo

In the end, you'll have a production-ready NFT Drop that your users can mint from!
