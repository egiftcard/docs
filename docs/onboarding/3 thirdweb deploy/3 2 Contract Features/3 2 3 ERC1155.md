# ERC1155 Standard Features

Using ERC1155 features lets you add standard ERC1155 compliant NFTfunctionality to your contracts. These interfaces can give your contract simple read-only functionality as well as more complex features like NFT minting and transfers.

We support a number of different ERC1155 features on your contracts that enable different SDK and dashboard functionality. Let's explore all the options below!

## ERC1155

The most standard ERC1155 interface, which is often considered the default and is implemented by most ERC1155 tokens, is the [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standard.

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for all of the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

You can get an initial instance for your contract with the following code:

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC1155" />

## Extensions

In addition to the standard ERC1155 interface, we also support the following additional ERC1155 features which you can add onto your contract ERC1155 contract. 

:::info
Note that in order to use these features, the contract must also implement the standard ERC1155 interface as well.

### ERC155Mintable

The ERC155Mintable interface enables you to add minting functionality to your NFTs. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableER155](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC155) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/ThirdwebContract.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC155.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is ThirdwebContract, IMintableERC155 {

    // Implement functions here
    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external returns (uint256) {
        
    }
}
```

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC155Mintable" />

### ERC1155BatchMintable

The ERC1155BatchMintable interface enables you to add batch minting functionality to your tokens. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableERC1155](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC1155) and [IMulticall](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMulticall) interfaces as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/ThirdwebContract.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC1155.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMulticall.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is ThirdwebContract, IMintableERC1155, IMulticall {

    // Implement your functions below
    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external returns (uint256) {
        
    }

    function multicall(bytes[] data) external nonpayable returns (bytes[] results) {

    }
}
```

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC1155BatchMintable" />


### ERC1155Enumerable

The ERC1155Enumerable interface enables you to add enumerable functionality to your NFTs. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IERC1155Enumerable](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IERC1155Enumerable) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/ThirdwebContract.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is ThirdwebContract {

  // Implement your functions below
  function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256) {

  }
}
```

If your contract implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following SDK interface.
