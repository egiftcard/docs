# ERC20 Standard Features

Using ERC20 features let you add standard ERC20 compliant token functionality to your contracts. These interfaces can give your contract simple read-only functionality as well as more complex features like token minting and transfers.

// TODO pull in the feature snippets from the TS repo to map Contract interface to SDK functions

// TODO create quick component that can render an entry from `import jsonData from "../../docs/feature_snippets.json";`
