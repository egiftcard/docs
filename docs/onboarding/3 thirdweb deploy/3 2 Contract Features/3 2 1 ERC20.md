# ERC20 Standard Features

Using ERC20 features lets you add standard ERC20 compliant token functionality to your contracts. These interfaces can give your contract simple read-only functionality as well as more complex features like token minting and transfers.

We support a number of different ERC20 features on your contracts that enable different SDK and dashboard functionality. Let's explore all the options below!

## ERC20

The most standard ERC20 interface, which is often considered the default and is implemented by most ERC20 tokens, is the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for all of the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

You can get an initial instance for your contract with the following code:

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC20" />

## Extensions

In addition to the standard ERC20 interface, we also support the following additional ERC20 features which you can add onto your contract.

:::info
In order to use these features, the contract must also implement the standard ERC20 interface as well.

### ERC20Mintable

The ERC20Mintable interface enables you to add minting functionality to your tokens. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC20) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/ThirdwebContract.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC20.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is ThirdwebContract, IMintableERC20 {

    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external returns (uint256) {
        // implement your mint function
    }
}
```

If your contract implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC20Mintable" />

### ERC20BatchMintable

The ERC20BatchMintable interface enables you to add batch minting functionality to your tokens. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC20) and [IMulticall](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMulticall) interfaces as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/ThirdwebContract.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC20.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMulticall.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is ThirdwebContract, IMintableERC20, IMulticall {

    // Implement your functions below
    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external returns (uint256) {

    }

    function multicall(bytes[] data) external nonpayable returns (bytes[] results) {

    }
}
```

If your contract implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.
