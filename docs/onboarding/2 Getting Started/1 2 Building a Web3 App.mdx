title: Building a Web3 App
---

Now that we've deployed an NFT Drop contract from the dashboard, we can build a frontend application using the thirdweb [React](/react) SDK to enable our users to connect their wallets and claim NFTs.

## Creating a New App

The easiest way to get started is by using our CLI.

This interactive tool creates a new project with thirdweb pre-configured with a framework and language of your choice.

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

That's it! You're ready to start building your project, and all the setup gets auto generated for you, including the wallet connection functionality.

:::tip Starter Kits & Templates

You can start with one of our [template projects](/templates) by passing the `--template` flag and the name of the example repo.

## Understanding the Code

Let's quickly take a look at the generated code to understand what's going on in our app.

This entry point of the app is where we configure the `ThirdwebProvider`, which allows us to use wallet connection features and interact with the desired blockchain.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Here we can specify the chainId our app should run on
// In this example, we'll use the Polygon Mumbai Testnet
const desiredChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

The template has a basic setup for users to connect their wallets to our page. It uses the `useMetamask()` to let a user connect their wallet to your app. For other ways to connect wallets, check out the [documentation](/react/category/wallet-connection).

```jsx
import { useAddress, useMetamask, useDisconnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  const address = useAddress();
  // This function will allow the user to connect their metamask wallet to our page
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const disconnectWallet = useDisconnect();
  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <>
          <button onClick={disconnectWallet}>Disconnect Wallet</button>
          <p>Your address: {address}</p>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect with Metamask</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Interacting with your Smart Contract

Now that we have a new web3 app ready to go, we need to get our smart contract into the app so we can start interacting with it.

You can do this by getting your smart contract address from the dashboard by clicking the copy address button below the contract name.

![Copy Contract Address from dashboard](./assets/copy-contract-address.png)

Copy this contract address, and use it to get an instance of your smart contract in code.

For example, we can get our NFT Drop contract using the code below:

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Component() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>");

  // Now you can use the nft drop contract in the rest of the component
}
```

Now you're ready to use the functions of your smart contract.

### Read Data from your contract

You can now read data from your contract with any of our [React](/react) hooks.

In the example below, we'll read and display all the NFTs on your drop contract.

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop, useNFTs, ThirdwebNftMedia } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function NFTGalleryComponent() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>");

  // Get all NFTs from this contract
  const { data: nfts, isLoading } = useNFTs(contract);

  // Display them in a gallery
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          {nfts.map((nft, id) => (
            <>
              <ThirdwebNftMedia key={id} metadata={nft.metadata} />
              <h3>{nft.metadata.name}</h3>
            </>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Perform transactions on your contract

You can make transactions to your contract from your frontend with the connected wallet.

In the below example, we'll setup a simple claiming page so that users can connect to your website and claim NFTs from your drop. You can put this component anywhere in your app,
the SDK will automatically prompt the connected wallet to execute the transaction.

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop, useAddress, useClaimNFT } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function ClaimButtonComponent() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>");
  const connectedWalletAddresss = useAddress();

  // Get the function to claim NFTs
  const { mutate: claim, isLoading } = useClaimNFT(contract);

  // And add a button to claim NFTs
  return (
    <button
      disabled={isLoading}
      onClick={() => claim({ to: connectedWalletAddresss, quantity: 1 })}
    >
      Claim NFT
    </button>
  );
}
```
