# Deploying Contracts

Create smart contracts using either the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) or the SDK.

## Deploying via the Dashboard

The easiest way to get started is to use the [**dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

- Click "Deploy New Contract".
- Select the contract you want to deploy from one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts).
- Configure the metadata, fees, and network.
