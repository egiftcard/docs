# Getting Started

Before we begin, it‚Äôs important to note that we‚Äôre going to be making some assumptions of your prior knowledge. We‚Äôll assume you already know:

- Basics of what the blockchain is and what ‚Äúweb3‚Äù means
- Terms like smart contracts, Ethereum, gas, and dApps
- What wallets such as MetaMask are, and ideally have a wallet yourself

If you‚Äôre not sure what some of those things are, we recommend you start at our [learn web3](https://portal.thirdweb.com/learn-web3) page and come back whenever you feel comfortable.

If you have any questions about anything related to thirdweb, you‚Äôre always welcome to come ask our community in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thirdweb).

In this section, we'll show you how to deploy an NFT Collection smart contract using thirdweb, and get you up and running with an application to view and mint new NFTs.

We'll show you how to use the core features of thirdweb, including:
- Deploying your very own smart contract
- Using the dashboard to view and configure your smart contract
- Connecting to your smart contract using our SDKs

We'll also explore some of the heavy lifting thirdweb does behind the scenes, like:
- Connecting to the blockchain for you
- Easily accessing user's wallets and signing transactions
- Fetching data from IPFS
- Caching results from the blockchain for faster access

Let's get started!
