# Getting Started

Let's now build your first web3 app with thirdweb.

_This section shouldn't take much longer than 5 minutes to set up and will guide you through deploying your own smart contract as well as teaching you how to interact with that smart contract using our React.JS SDK._

:::info Pre-requisites

- [React.JS](https://reactjs.org)
- basic web3-related terms ("Smart Contract", "dApp", "IPFS")
- You have a ethereum wallet (such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io))

_If you‚Äôre not sure what some of those things are, we recommend you start at our [learn web3](https://portal.thirdweb.com/learn-web3) page and return to this section whenever you feel comfortable._

:::

If you have any questions about anything related to thirdweb, you‚Äôre always welcome to come ask our community in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thirdweb).

## What you will build

In this section, we'll show you how to deploy an NFT Collection using thirdweb. Then we'll get you up and running with a simple React.JS application to view and mint new NFTs.

You'll learn how to use the core features of thirdweb, including:

- Deploying your very own smart contract
- Using the dashboard to view and configure your smart contract
- Connecting to your smart contract using our SDKs

We'll also touch on some of the heavy lifting thirdweb handles for you behind the scenes, like:

- Handling connections to the blockchain
- Letting users connect their wallets and sign transactions
- Fetching & storing data via IPFS
- Caching data from the blockchain for an improved user experience

Let's get started!
