# Deploying Contracts

You can deploy a smart contract onto the blockchain using either:

1. The [**dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
2. The **SDK**

## Dashboard Deployments

The easiest way to deploy a contract is to use the [**dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

To deploy a smart contract from the dashboard:

- Click "Deploy New Contract".
- Select the contract you want to deploy from one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts).
- Configure the metadata, fees, and network.
- Deploy!

:::note Gas & Test Networks

Deploying smart contracts is free, but blockchain transactions require **gas**.

You can deploy smart contracts onto a test network such as Mumbai Polygon Testnet for free, by getting test MATIC from [the official faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

## Deploying via the SDK

The SDK is capable of deploying **any** smart contract, including all of our pre-built contracts!

TODO : Add in the example scripts made in ts sdk for deploying contracts.
