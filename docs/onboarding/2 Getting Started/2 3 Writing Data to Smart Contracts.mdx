# Writing Data to Smart Contracts

To execute transactions on your contract, initialize the SDK

This can be done in two ways:

1. By connecting to a user's wallet (typically used in the frontend)
2. Using your private key (typically used in the backend or scripts)

## Connecting to a user's wallet

Use the [Quick Start Guide](/react) on our React SDK to learn how to connect to a user's wallet and execute transactions.

Or use `Create thirdweb App` to create a new project with wallet connection set-up.

```bash
npx create-tw-app
```

## Private key connection

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- Check if you actually need to use a private key for your application.
- **Never** directly expose your private key in your source code.
- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.
- **Never** use a private key for a frontend (website/dapp) application.

If you are unsure about how to securely store and access your private key please do not proceed.
