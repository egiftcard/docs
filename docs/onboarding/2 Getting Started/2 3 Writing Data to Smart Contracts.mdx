# Writing Data to Smart Contracts

To execute transactions on your contract, initialize the SDK with a valid **signer**.

This can be done in two ways:

1. By connecting to a user's wallet and have them sign transactions _(typically used in the frontend)_.
2. Using your private key _(typically used in the backend or scripts)_.

## Connecting to a user's wallet

The recommended way to connect to a user's wallet is to use the [React SDK](/react) to:

1. Wrap your application in the [ThirdwebProvider](/react/react.thirdwebprovider).
2. Use a [Wallet connection](/react/category/wallet-connection) hook.

### React SDK and the ThirdwebProvider

The `ThirdwebProvider` automatically switches the SDK to signer mode when a wallet is connected.

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={ChainId.Polygon}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Any transaction you attempt to make now will be made with the connected wallet (if they approve the transaction):

Below is an example of minting an NFT with the connected wallet's signer:

```jsx title="MintComponent.jsx"
import { useAddress, useMetamask, useNFTCollection } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const MintNFTComponent = () => {
  // Read the connected wallet's address (undefined if no connected wallet)
  const address = useAddress();
  // Function to connect the user's MetaMask wallet.
  const connectWallet = useMetamask();
  // Connect to your smart contract using the React SDK's hooks
  const nftCollection = useNFTCollection("<NFT-COLLECTION-CONTRACT-ADDRESS>");

  async function mint() {
    // If no address is connected, request wallet connection
    if (!address) {
      connectWallet();
    }
    // Otherwise, use the connected wallet to mint the NFT
    else {
      const transaction = await nftCollection.mintToSelf({
        name: "My NFT",
      });
    }
  }

  return <button onClick={mint}>Mint</button>;
};
```

### Manual configuration with signer

Alternatively, you can manually create an instance of the SDK with a signer.

```jsx
import { useSigner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// The React SDK exposes the connected signer.
// You could use this, or another library such as Ethers to create a signer object if you are not using the React SDK.
const signer = useSigner();

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromSigner(signer, "polygon");

// The SDK is now in signer mode.
const nftCollection = sdk.getNFTCollection("0x...");
const transaction = await nftCollection.mintToSelf({
  name: "My NFT",
});
```

## Private-key connection

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- Check if you need to use a private key for your application.
- **Never** directly expose your private key in your source code.
- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.
- **Never** use a private key for a frontend (website/dapp) application.

If you are unsure how to securely store and access your private key, please do not proceed.
