# Writing Data to Smart Contracts

To execute transactions on your contract, initialize the SDK

This can be done two ways:

1. By connecting to a user's wallet (typically used in the frontend)
2. Using your own private key (typically used in the backend or scripts)

## Connecting to a user's wallet

Use the [Quick Start Guide](/react) on our React SDK to learn how to connect to a user's wallet and execute transactions.

Or use `Create thirdweb App` to create a new project with wallet connection set-up.

```bash
npx create-tw-app
```

## Private key connection

:::warning Warning

Always load your private key in a secure manner like environment variables. Never commit it to Git.

Do not ever use your private key on a client-side application.
