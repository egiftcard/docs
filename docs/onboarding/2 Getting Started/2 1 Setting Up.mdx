- Set-up a [read-only SDK Instance](/getting-started/reading-data-from-smart-contracts).
- Set-up a [signer SDK Instance](/getting-started/writing-data-to-smart-contracts) (sign transactions).

## Deploying Contracts

You can deploy contracts using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), or programmatically using the SDK.

The SDK enables more complex use-cases such as allowing the connected wallet to deploy contracts.

### Dashboard

The [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) is the easiest way to deploy a [pre-built contract](/pre-built-contracts).

- Navigate to [https://thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
- Click "Deploy New Contract".
- Select the contract you want to use.
- Configure the metadata, fees, and network.
- Deploy!

:::info Gas & Test Networks

Deploying smart contracts is free, but blockchain transactions require **gas**.

### SDK

The SDK is also capable of deploying all of our pre-built contracts.

_For example, to create an NFT Drop contract:_
