title: Building a Web3 App
---

Now that we've deployed an NFT Drop contract from the dashboard, we can build a frontend application using the thirdweb [React](/react) SDK to enable our users to connect their wallets and claim NFTs.

## Creating a New App

The easiest way to get started is by using our `create-tw-app` CLI.

This interactive tool creates a new project with thirdweb pre-configured with a framework and language of your choice.

```bash
npx create-tw-app
```

That's it! You're project is ready to start [interacting with your contract](/getting-started/interact-with-your-contract).

:::tip Starter Kits & Templates

You can start with one of our [example projects](/examples) by passing the `--example` flag and the name of the example repo.

<!-- Connect Wallet (SS) -->


## Getting Your Smart Contract

Now that we have a new web3 app ready to go, we need to get our smart contract into the app so we can start interacting with it. 

You can do this by getting your smart contract address from the dashboard by clicking the copy address button below the contract name.

![Copy Contract Address from dashboard](./assets/copy-contract-address.png)

Copy this contract address, and use it to get an instance of your smart contract in code.

For example, we can get our NFT Drop contract using the code below:

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop } from '@thirdweb-dev/react'

export default function Component() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>")

  // Now you can use the nft drop contract in the rest of the component
}
```

## Using Your Smart Contract

Now you're ready to use the functions of your smart contract.

### Read Data

You can now read data from your contract with any of our [React](/react) hooks.

In the example below, we'll read and display all the NFTs on your drop contract.

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop, ThirdwebNftMedia } from '@thirdweb-dev/react'

export default function Component() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>");

  // Read data about all NFTs from this contract
  const { data: nfts, isLoading } = useNFTs(contract);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          {nfts.map((nft, id) => (
            <>
              <ThirdwebNftMedia 
                key={id} 
                metadata={nft.metadata} 
              />
              <h3>{nft.metadata.name}</h3>
            </>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Write Data (Create Transaction)

You can make transactions to your contract from your frontend with the connected wallet.

In the below example, we'll setup a simple claiming page so that users can connect to your website and claim NFTs from your drop.

```jsx
import { useNFTDrop } from '@thirdweb-dev/react'

export default function Component() {
  const contract = useNFTDrop("<contract-address>");

  // Get the function to claim NFTs
  const { mutate: claim, isLoading } = useClaimNFT(contract);

  // And add a button to claim NFTs
  return (
    <button
      disabled={isLoading}
      onClick={() => claim({ to: "0x...", quantity: 1 })}
    >
      Claim NFT!
    </button>
  );
}
```
