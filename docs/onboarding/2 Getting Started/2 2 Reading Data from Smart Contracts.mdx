# Reading Data from Smart Contracts

Initialize a read-only instance of the SDK to start reading data from any smart contract.

The SDK handles the complexities of querying data, such as:

- Resolving metadata from IPFS
- Pagination
- Caching _(React SDK only)_

## Getting Smart Contracts

The SDK can read data from any smart contract,
and includes specialized functionality for [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts).

_For example, to get your NFT Drop contract:_

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"NFTDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
  showHr={false}
/>

_Then read all NFTs from the NFT Drop:_

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"getAll"} showHr={false} />
