# Creating Custom Contracts

All the individual elements that make up our pre-built contracts are available in our [Solidity SDK](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions),
for you to piece together various parts of our contracts and customize them to build your own!

This page will show you how to create and release your own [ERC-721A](https://www.erc721a.org/) NFT collection.

## Creating a Custom Contract

Install the [Solidity SDK](/contracts) into your new or existing project by running the following command:

```bash
# For new projects
npm init -y

# Then, install the Solidity SDK
npm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

Create a new file called `MyNFT.sol` in this directory.

### Starting From A Base Contract

Base contracts give us a great starting point with functionality already implemented for us.

To create a contract that "starts out" as a base contract, such as the [ERC721Base](/solidity-sdk/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base), we need to:

1. Import the contract from the SDK.
2. Inherit the contract, by saying `MyNFT is ERC721Base`.
3. Implement any [required methods](/solidity-sdk/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base#implementing-the-contract-extension) such as the `constructor`.

```solidity title="MyNFT.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {
      constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {}
}
```

### Add Contract Extensions

To add more functionality, we can write any custom logic or
begin to implement additional contract extensions; such as [Permissions](/solidity-sdk/contract-extensions/permissions),
by following the same pattern as we did for the base contract.

**1. Import the contract from the SDK.**

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumberable.sol";
```

**2. Inherit the contract, by saying `MyNFT is PermissionsEnumberable`.**

```solidity
contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, PermissionsEnumberable {
    // ...
}
```

**3. Implement any required methods such as the `constructor`.**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumerable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, PermissionsEnumerable {
      constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {
        // Give the contract deployer the "admin" role when the contract is deployed.
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now we've written our contract, let's share it with the world!

Next, we'll learn how to use the CLI to create a versioned **release** of our contract, and then **deploy** it from the dashboard.
