### Wallet SDK

thirdweb’s Wallet SDK is an all-in-one web3 wallet development framework that provides:

- 1-line of code to integrate with a broad set of wallet types including: non-custodial wallets, semi-custodial/custodial wallets, email wallets, device wallets, and smart contract wallets
- Easy plug-and-play UI components for any wallets on any platforms to easily enable “ConnectWallet” for end user

### Email/Social Wallets (beta)

thirdweb allows companies to create secure wallets on behalf of their users that require nothing more than an email or social login from the user.

### Integration with Payment Services

The Wallet SDK also provides out of the box integration with payment services like [Coinbase Pay](https://portal.thirdweb.com/gamingkit/wallet-actions/fund-wallets) and [Stripe](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/thirdweb-stripe).
