# Publish

Use the [CLI](/cli) to publish your contracts directly to **Any EVM compatible chain** using the [dashboard](/dashboard):

```bash
npx thirdweb publish
```

This command will:

- Compile your smart contract.
- Upload the contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
- Open the publish flow in the dashboard.

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.publish.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>

## How to Publish Your Contract

In your browser, follow the steps below to publish your contract:

### Configure Contract Metadata

From the dashboard, provide the metadata for your smart contract including:

- **Name**
- **Image**
- **Description**
- **README** - Markdown is supported. What your contract does, common use cases & examples are great things to include here.

### Add A Version & Audit Report (Optional)

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to incrementally publish new versions of your smart contract;
ideal for when you want to make changes to your smart contract but don't want to break existing integrations.

Each version of your smart contract is stored on-chain and can be deployed by anyone. You
can optionally include release notes, to describe the changes you've made between versions.

You can also link each version to an audit report. You can paste a link to it, or drag and drop a PDF. We will generate an IPFS link for you.

### Choose how users will deploy your published contract

Select the contract type for your published contract

- Direct Deploy: Choose this option if your contract does not follow the upgradeable contract pattern.
  - This option can be used for **any contract**
  - there are no requirements for using this option to publish your contract. 
  - Users will deploy the **full contract**: storage and implementation logic.
- [Deploy via Factory](/publish/deploy-via-factory): Choose this option if you would like users to deploy proxies of your contract using the thirdweb default factory contract or using your own pre-deployed custom factory.
  - [Default Factory](/publish/deploy-via-factory#default-factory) - Use this option to use the thirdweb default factory if your contract follows the upgradeable contract pattern.
  - [Custom Factory](/publish/deploy-via-factory#custom-factory) - Use this option to use your own pre-deployed custom factory to create proxies for your users.

Once selected, click "Next" to move on to the flow corresponding to the contract type selected.

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Direct Deploy              | Users can deploy a copy of your contract, including the logic and storage.                                           | Smart contract developers using publish to share their smart contract and are not expecting their contract to get lots of deploys      | No requirements.                                                                                                      | Yes.                                                          | No.                                        |
| Deploy via Default Factory | Users can deploy proxies of your implementation contract, containing the storage, using the thirdweb default factory | Protocols that want their contract to be deployable to all networks and want to gas-optimize the deploys                               | Must be written in the [upgradeable pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable). | Yes.                                                          | Yes.                                       |
| Deploy via Custom Factory  | Use your own pre-deployed factory contract to deploy proxies for your users.                                         | Protocols that want to use a custom factory to create proxies for their users & the ability to add custom logic to the create function.| Must have pre-deployed a custom factory on each chain you would like users to be able to deploy to.                   | Deployable to all networks the custom factory is deployed to. | Yes.                                       |

### Customize Contract Parameters

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by changing what your contract parameters look like. These are fields that users need to enter before deploying your contract with each field corresponding to the associated variable in the constructor of your contract.

- **Display name**: Use this to have a more readable version of the parameter name. Otherwise, the parameter name from the contract will be shown as is.
- **Default value**: This will be pre-filled in the deploy form. Use this to guide users on what value to enter. If the parameter is of the address datatype, you can pre-fill the users connected wallet address by setting the default value as {{connected_wallet}}
- **Description**: Use this to clear up any confusion and explain what value this parameter is expecting
- **Advanced**: Tick this option if you want to hide this parameter from the deploy form. This is useful for parameters that are not required to be changed by the user. This option is only available for parameters that have a default value.
