When publishing a contract, you can choose to let others deploy a "proxy" of a pre-deployed contract. Since proxies are much lighter weight than the actual full contract, they are much cheaper to deploy. Proxy deploys only requiring a fraction of the gas of a normal deploy.

### Publishing proxy contracts

This feature has a requirement. The "main" contract, referred to as the "implementation", needs to be deployed on chain already. You can not publish normal contracts as proxies, they need to be written as per the [EIP-1967 spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967).

To publish a proxy contract, your contract needs to implement the [upgradeable pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable), generally means it has an "initialize" function instead of a regular constructor.

If you haven't already deployed your implementation contracts, you can do so using the UI. Just click on the ðŸš€ button next to the desired network.

Click the "Next" button and customize your initializer parameters. This is what will be shown to users when they try to deploy your contract.

Finally, publish your Proxy contract(s) by clicking the "Publish Contract" button.

Now anyone can deploy proxies of your contract simply by clicking "Deploy" on your published contract page.

Another way to let users deploy your contracts is by using a factory contract. This allows you to not only provide cheap deployments, but also to add extra logic that will be executed when others deploy your contracts.

### Publishing factory contracts

To enable factory deploys, you will need to deploy a factory contract that implements the [IContractFactory interface](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IContractFactory). This is a simple interface with one function that you can implement to add deploy contracts any way you like, and add your custom logic on top. This is extremely useful when deploying a contract requires multiple steps, having the factory take care of the heavy lifting.

Fill in the addresses of your factory contracts on each chain. This means you need to deploy your implementations like for proxy, but also add your factory addresses.

Click the "Next" button and fill out the details of the parameters on your contract.

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by providing a display name, default value, and description of each contract parameter.

Finally to publish your contract, click the "Publish Contract" button.

That's it, now when people click deploy from your published contract page, your factory function will be invoked.
