# FAQs

### If I publish my contracts, are they visible for everyone to see?

Yes, once published, anyone will be able to see the smart contract through the shareable dashboard link.

### How can I search for contracts published by others?

Published contracts can be discovered using the shareable URL or by being posted on the [Explore](https://thirdweb.com/explore) directory. However, there is currently no option to search for all published contracts.

### Can I un-publish my contract?

Contracts that are published are stored on the Polygon blockchain permanently. Once published, it is not possible to un-publish the contract due to the immutable nature of blockchains.
