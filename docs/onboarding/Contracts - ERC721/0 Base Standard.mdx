# ERC721

ERC721 is the standard for representing NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

## Implementing The Contract

We recommend implementing the ERC721A standard to build your NFT smart contracts; which is
a gas-optimized variation of the ERC721 standard.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/ERC721A.sol";

contract Contract is ERC721A {
      constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC721A(
            _name,
            _symbol
        )
    {}
}
```

## Unlocked Features

When you deploy your contract using thirdweb, you unlock the features of the dashboard
and the SDK to easily interact with your smart contract. You can check which features your contract
has successfully implemented by running:

```bash
npx thirdweb detect
```
