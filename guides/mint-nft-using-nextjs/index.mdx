# Mint an NFT using Next.js

An example that uses Next.js to:

- View all NFTs in an [NFT Collection](/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection)
- Allow a connected wallet to mint new NFTs if they have the `minter` role.

<!-- truncate -->

## Create an NFT Collection contract

1. Go to [https://thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), connect your wallet and click on the **Deploy new contract** button.
2. Select the **NFT Collection** from the Pre-built contracts and click **Deploy Now**
3. Enter the metadata for your contract, such as image, name, symbol, description and royalty fees.
4. Select the network you want to deploy to, learn more about the available networks in our [Which Blockchain & Network Should I Use Guide](/guides/which-network-should-you-use)
5. Click **Deploy Now** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
6. Click to copy the **Contract Address** at the top left of the page.

## Creating the Project

You can create a new Next.js app with our Web3 SDK pre-configured by using the [CLI](/cli):

```bash
npx thirdweb create --next my-minting-app
```

:::info Manual Installation

Alternatively, install our Web3 SDKs into your Next app:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react ethers
```

:::

## Setting up the ThirdwebProvider

Inside the `_app.js` file, we wrap our application in the `ThirdwebProvider`:

This comes pre-configured when you use our CLI.

Be sure to change the `activeChainId` to the chain you deployed to.

```jsx title="_app.js"
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Viewing all NFTs from the collection

We can use the [useNFTCollection](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usenftcollection) and
[useNFTs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usenfts) hooks from the React SDK to:

- Get the NFT Collection smart contract in our application
- View all the NFTs and their metadata

Use this code in your `index.js` file:

```jsx title="index.js"
import {
  ThirdwebNftMedia,
  useNFTCollection,
  useNFTs,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function NFTCollectionView() {
  // Get the NFT collection using its contract address
  const nftCollection = useNFTCollection(
    "your-nft-collection-contract-address-here",
  );

  // Load all the NFTs from the collection (with a loading flag)
  const { data: nfts, isLoading } = useNFTs(nftCollection);

  // .map over the nfts array, rendering each NFT as a div containing the media asset and name.
  return (
    <div>
      {!isLoading ? (
        <div>
          {nfts?.map((nft) => (
            <div key={nft.metadata.id.toString()}>
              <ThirdwebNftMedia metadata={nft.metadata} />
              <h3>{nft.metadata.name}</h3>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}

      {/* Here's where we put the next section (the mint button) */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

We use the [ThirdwebNftMedia](/react/react.thirdwebnftmedia) to display the NFT's media asset, which
is a component that renders the asset correctly based on the file type. e.g. uses an `<img>` tag if the
NFT media is an image, or a `<video>` tag if it's a video.

## Minting new NFTs

For a wallet to mint NFTs in an NFT Collection contract, they need to have the `minter` role on the contract.

You can configure this via the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), in the **Permissions** tab of your contract, by adding a wallet address in the `Creator` section.

We can use the [useMintNFT](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usemintnft) hook from the React SDK to mint new NFTs from the connected wallet address.

```jsx
import { useMintNFT } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { mutate: mintNft, isLoading, error } = useMintNFT(nftCollection);
```

Then, beneath our previous `div`, we can add a button that calls this function with some NFT metadata:

To call the `mintNft` function, we'll need a **signer** to sign the mint transaction, so we can show the user a "Connect Wallet" button if they are not connected.

To do that, we can use the `useAddress` hook to view the connected address, and the `useMetamask` hook to connect the wallet:

```jsx
import { useAddress, useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const address = useAddress();
const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
```

Then show a different button depending on the value of `address`:

```jsx
{
  address ? (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        mintNft({
          metadata: {
            name: "My awesome NFT",
          },
          to: address,
        })
      }
    >
      Mint!
    </button>
  ) : (
    <button onClick={() => connectWithMetamask()}>Connect Wallet</button>
  );
}
```
