# How to create an NFT-gated website

In this guide, we will create a website that restricts content based on owning an NFT using React.

<!-- truncate -->

In this guide, we use an [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop), which allows many NFTs to be created from the same asset, which is perfect for a membership card!

## Using the template repository

To get started, we can use the CLI to clone a starter kit.

```bash
npx thirdweb create --next --js
```

## Setup the ThirdwebProvider

Inside the `pages/_app.js` page, we wrap our application in the `ThirdwebProvider` component to access all of the React SDK's hooks anywhere in our application.

In this file we need to configure a `desiredChainId` that our project will work on.

For this project, weâ€™ll be using `Mumbai` since our Edition Drop contract is on the Mumbai testnet.

```jsx title="_app.js"
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Requesting Restricted content

On the homepage (`index.js`), there is a connect wallet and disconnect wallet
button set up for us!

This setup conditionally renders the `Connect Wallet` button if there is no `address` detected,
and the `Disconnect Wallet` button next to the connected wallet address if there is.

Let's modify this file a little bit now.

When there is a connected wallet, we'll show the user a button for them to request access to the NFT-gated content,
as well as another button for them to claim one of the NFTs from our drop.

```jsx title="index.js"
return (
  <div>
    {address ? (
      <>
        <button
          className={styles.secondaryButton}
          onClick={() => {
            claimNft({
              quantity: 1,
              tokenId: 0,
              to: address,
            });
          }}
        >
          Claim NFT
        </button>

        <button onClick={() => requestAuthenticatedContent()}>
          Request Content
        </button>
      </>
    ) : (
      <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Wallet</button>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

When the user clicks the `Request Content` button, we call a function called `requestAuthenticatedContent`, _(which we haven't written yet)_ let's do that now.

This function asks the user to sign a message with their wallet using the
[Auth SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/building-web3-apps/authenticating-users)
to prove the user owns this wallet, and generate a **login payload**.

We then this login payload in the body of a `fetch` request to an [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

This API route uses the Auth SDK to verify the login payload is valid, which means the user who sent this request is the owner of the wallet.

If the login payload is valid, we then check to see if the user owns an NFT, and send back the restricted content if they do.

```jsx title="index.js"
const sdk = useSDK();

// For user to claim an NFT to then view the restricted content
const editionDropContract = useEditionDrop(
  "0x1fCbA150F05Bbe1C9D21d3ab08E35D682a4c41bF", // replace this with your contract address
);

// Function to make a request to our /api/get-restricted-content route to check if we own an NFT.
async function requestAuthenticatedContent() {
  // Add the domain of the application users will login to, this will be used throughout the login process
  const domain = "thirdweb.com";

  // Generate a signed login payload for the connected wallet to authenticate with
  const loginPayload = await sdk.auth.login(domain);

  // Make api request to server
  const response = await fetch(`/api/get-restricted-content`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      loginPayload,
    }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    alert(`Here's your content: ${data.message}`);
  } else {
    alert(
      "Unauthorized! You don't own an NFT, so you can't view the content, sorry!",
    );
  }
}
```

Additionally, users who don't own an NFT can claim one using the `claim` button we defined,
which we can attach to the `useClaimNFT` hook from the React SDK to allow users to claim NFTs:

```jsx title="index.js"
// Hook to claim NFTs from the NFT drop (to allow users to claim and *then* view the restricted content)
const { mutate: claimNft, isLoading: isClaiming } =
  useClaimNFT(editionDropContract);
```

We need to import all of thes hooks into our `index.js` file too.

```jsx title="index.js"
import {
  useAddress,
  useDisconnect,
  useMetamask,
  useEditionDrop,
  useClaimNFT,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Checking NFT Balance

Create a new folder inside your `pages` directory called `api`, and within that folder, create a file called `get-restricted-content.js`.

This is where our logic on the server-side will live, and conditionally serve content based on the user's NFT balance.

First, we need to verify the login payload the user sent with this request, which proves the person who made this request owns the wallet.

```jsx title="api/get-restricted-content"
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Get the login payload out of the request
  const { loginPayload } = JSON.parse(req.body);

  // SDK instantiation (read-only)
  const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("mumbai");

  // Verify the login request
  const domain = "thirdweb.com";
  const verified = sdk.auth.verify(domain, loginPayload);

  if (!verified) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  // Now check if the user meets the criteria to see this content
  // (e.g. they own an NFT from the collection)
  const editionDrop = sdk.getEditionDrop(
    "0x1fCbA150F05Bbe1C9D21d3ab08E35D682a4c41bF", // replace this with your contract address
  );

  // Get addresses' balance of token ID 0
  const balance = await editionDrop.balanceOf(loginPayload.payload.address, 0);

  if (balance > 0) {
    // If the user is verified and has an NFT, return the content
    res.status(200).json({
      message: "This is the restricted content",
    });
  } else {
    // If the user is verified but doesn't have an NFT, return a message
    res.status(200).json({
      message: "You don't have an NFT",
    });
  }
}
```
