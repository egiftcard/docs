# Mint an NFT Collection with TypeScript

This guide explains how to mint an NFT Collection using the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript).

<!-- truncate -->

You can deploy an NFT Collection via the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), but in this guide, we'll demonstrate how to do it using TypeScript!

Create a new directory called `my-nft-collection`, and within this folder, create a file called `mint-nft-collection.ts`.

## Installing TypeScript SDK

Install the required dependencies to get started with thirdweb, by running the following command inside your `my-nft-collection` folder.:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk dotenv
```

## Deploying an NFT Collection

To deploy an NFT Collection using the SDK, we can make use of the [sdk.deployer](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.deployer),
which can create any of thirdweb's [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts)!

To deploy from your wallet, you'll first need to export your wallet's private key and add it to an environment variable in this project.

:::info How to export your private key

Learn how to [export your private key](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key) from your wallet.

:::

To do this, create a file called `.env` in the same folder as your `mint-nft-collection.ts` file, and add the following to it:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.

:::

Now we're ready to deploy the NFT Collection!

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import "dotenv/config";

async function main() {
  const NETWORK = "mumbai";
  const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
    NETWORK,
  );

  const deployedAddress = await sdk.deployer.deployNFTCollection({
    name: "My NFT Collection",
    primary_sale_recipient: "0x-your-public-wallet-address-here",
  });
  console.log(deployedAddress);
}

main();
```

Now we are ready to deploy our NFT Collection, but before we do, let's mint some NFTs in our script.

## Minting NFTs

The parameters used here are the same as minting an NFT inside the dashboard.
If you want to familiarize yourself with the process, check out the dashboard!

```tsx
const nftCollection = sdk.getNFTCollection(deployedAddress);

const nft = await nftCollection.mintTo("0x-your-public-wallet-address-here", {
  name: "My NFT",
});

console.log(nft);
```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash
# Runs the TypeScript file
npx ts-node mint-nft-collection.ts
```

## That's it!

You have minted your own NFT Collection using thirdweb and the TypeScript SDK, you should be proud!
