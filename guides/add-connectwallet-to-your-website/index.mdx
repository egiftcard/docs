# Add a connect wallet button to your website

Learn how to easily add a connect wallet button to your web application using the [React SDK](/react).

<!--truncate-->

## Introduction

Setting up web3 on your website and letting your users connect their wallets is essential for any web3 web app.

Our Web3 SDK allows you to connect to all of the most popular wallets:

- [MetaMask](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usemetamask)
- [WalletConnect](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usewalletconnect)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecoinbasewallet)
- [Gnosis Safe](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usegnosis)
- [Magic.Link](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usemagic)

:::tip

Wallet connection comes pre-configured when you create new projects using the [CLI](/cli):

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

:::

## Get Started

To get started with thirdweb, you can run the following to install our packages into an existing React project:

```bash
# Run this to install with npm
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers

# Or run this to install with yarn
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```

Once you've installed the necessary packages, set up the `ThirdwebProvider` to wrap the rest of your application:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const desiredChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

  /**
   * Make sure that your app is wrapped with these contexts.
   * If you're using React, you'll have to replace the Component setup with {children}
   */
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Connect Wallet

Now you're ready to use one of our [Wallet Connection](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/category/wallet-connection) hooks to connect users' wallets to your site.

```jsx
import {
  useMetamask,
  useWalletConnect,
  useCoinbaseWallet,
  useNetwork,
  useAddress,
  useDisconnect,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
export const ConnectWallet = () => {
  const connectWithCoinbaseWallet = useCoinbaseWallet();
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const connectWithWalletConnect = useWalletConnect();
  const disconnectWallet = useDisconnect();
  const address = useAddress();
  const network = useNetwork();
  // If a wallet is connected, show address, chainId and disconnect button
  if (address) {
    return (
      <div>
        Address: {address}
        <br />
        Chain ID: {network[0].data.chain && network[0].data.chain.id}
        <br />
        <button onClick={disconnectWallet}>Disconnect</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  // If no wallet is connected, show connect wallet options
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => connectWithCoinbaseWallet()}>
        Connect Coinbase Wallet
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => connectWithMetamask()}>Connect MetaMask</button>
      <button onClick={() => connectWithWalletConnect()}>
        Connect WalletConnect
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then, we need to import this component on our `index.tsx` file:

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { ConnectWallet } from "../components/ConnectWallet";
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </div>
  );
};
export default Home;
```
