When using a testnet, you'll need some funds to cover the **gas** for transactions onto the blockchain.

If you're new to web3 development, check out our guide on [Which Blockchain & Network Should I Use](/guides/which-network-should-you-use)
to learn more about testnets and why you might want to use one.

## Get a Metamask Wallet

To store tokens and pay for transactions on the blockchain, you'll need a **wallet**.

A popular wallet is [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), which is a browser extension that allows you to interact with the blockchain, and approve transactions.

To get started with MetaMask, follow our [Create a MetaMask wallet guide](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

## Add Polygon Mumbai Testnet to your Network list

We'll go to [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/), search "mumbai", and click **"Connect Wallet"**.
