# Create your own token with TypeScript

Create ERC20 tokens that can be used as your own currency with the thirdweb TypeScript SDK.

<!-- truncate -->

## Intro

You can deploy a [Token](/pre-built-contracts/tokens) via the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), but in this guide, we'll demonstrate how to do it using TypeScript!

Create a new folder on your computer called `my-token`, and within this folder, create a file called `mint-token.ts`.

## Installing TypeScript SDK

Install the required dependencies to get started with thirdweb, by running the following command inside your `my-token` folder.:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk
```

## Deploying a Token Contract

To deploy a Token using the SDK, we can make use of the [sdk.deployer](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.deployer),
which can create any of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts)!

To deploy from your wallet, you'll first need to export your wallet's private key.

:::info How to export your private key

Learn how to [export your private key](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key) from your wallet.

:::

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.

[Learn more about securely accessing your private key](/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key).

:::

Now we're ready to deploy the Token!

```typescript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

async function main() {
  const NETWORK = "mumbai";

  // Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
    "<your-private-key-here>"
    NETWORK,
  );

  const deployedAddress = await sdk.deployer.deployToken({
    name: "My Token",
    primary_sale_recipient: "0x-your-public-wallet-address-here",
  });
  console.log(deployedAddress);

  // Add the next code snippet here
}

main();
```

Before we run this script, let's add some code to some tokens immediately after we create the smart contract!

## Minting Tokens

To mint tokens, we:

- Get the token contract using its contract address
- Call the `mintTo` function with our address and desired quantity

Be sure to replace the `primary_sale_recipient` and `toAddress` with a valid wallet address.

```typescript
const tokenContract = sdk.getToken(deployedAddress);

const toAddress = "0x-your-public-wallet-address-here"; // Address of the wallet you want to mint the tokens to
const amount = "1.5"; // The amount of this token you want to mint

const transaction = await tokenContract.mintTo(toAddress, amount);

console.log(transaction);
```

To run the script, run:

```bash
npx ts-node mint-token.ts
```

## That's it!

Congratulations! You have created your own ERC20 token!
