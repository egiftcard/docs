# Create your own token with Python

In this guide, we will create tokens that can be used as a currency with the thirdweb Python SDK.

<!-- truncate -->

## Intro

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and deploy a new **Token** contract.

- Click **Deploy New contract**
- Click Deploy Now on the **Token** contract
- Configure your metadata, and deploy the contract to the Mumbai (MATIC) test network.

## Minting Tokens

You can easily mint tokens on the thirdweb dashboard by clicking on the **Mint** button.

But in this guide, we'll mint tokens using Python!

Go ahead and create a new Python file. Let's call it `currency.py` and open it in your favorite code editor.

Use the following code in your terminal to install the thirdweb SDK in the project!

```bash
pip install thirdweb-sdk
```

We'll also use environment variables, so install the `python-dotenv` package too:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Now we can import the SDK, along with the other libraries we're going to use.

```python title="currency.py"
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
```

To sign transactions from your wallet, we need to create a `.env` file and connect our wallet using its private key.

:::info How to export your private key

Learn how to [export your private key](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key) from your wallet.

:::

To do this, create a file called `.env` in the same folder as your `currency.py` file, and add the following to it:

```bash title=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.

:::

Now we can initialize our SDK:

```python
# Load environment variables into this file
load_dotenv()

# This PRIVATE KEY is coming from your environment variables. Make sure to never put it in a tracked file or share it with anyone.
PRIVATE_KEY = os.environ.get("PRIVATE_KEY")

# Set the network you want to operate on, or add your own RPC URL here
NETWORK = "mumbai"

# Finally, you can create a new instance of the SDK to use
sdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY, NETWORK)
```

## Minting Tokens

Now let's connect to our token smart contract in our Python code.

To do that, grab your contract address from the dashboard, and use it to get the contract instance.

```python
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x..." # Replace with your contract address
token = sdk.get_token(TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
```

And finally, mint some tokens!

```python
token.mint(10)
```

To run the code: `python currency.py`

## Conclusion

That's it! You've successfully created your own ERC-20 token and minted supply using Python!
