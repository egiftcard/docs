# Create your own token with Python

In this guide we will create tokens that can be used as your own currency with the thirdweb Python SDK

<!-- truncate -->

:::info Deprecated
This guide uses Python v1 SDK, which is deprecated.
We'll be updating this guide soon to use Python v2 SDK.
:::

## Intro

This guide explains how to create your own currency. We need to create a project in the dashboard and create a **Token** module inside our project. We also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with **MetaMask** or **CoinWallet**. If you don't have a MetaMask wallet, you can follow [our guide](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://v1.thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create a project and a **Bundle Collection** module.

Once your **Token** module has been created, it's time to mint our own currency, but we don't need the dashboard for that! For use cases where the interaction has a high frequency and requires conditions, using the sdk is more efficient.

## The code

### 1. Create a Python file and fire up a virtual environment

Go ahead and create a new Python file. Let's call it `currency.py` and open it in your favourite code editor. We'll use Visual Studio Code.

Next up use the following code in your terminal to create a virtual environment and install the ThirdWeb SDK!

### Virtual-env

```bash title="virtual-env"
#create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./myenv

#activate virtual environment
source ./myenv/bin/activate

#install the thirdweb sdk
pip install thirdweb-sdk
```

### Conda

```bash title="virtual-env"
#create a virtual environment
conda create -n "thirdweb" python=3.9

#activate virtual environment
conda activate thirdweb

#install the thirdweb sdk
pip install thirdweb-sdk
```

### 2. Import the SDK

Let's take the code step by step. At the end we'll include a full code snippet.

Import the following classes from the SDK.

We will use the **dotenv** library for our private key in a bit.

```python title="currency.py"
# Importing stuff
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSdk, SdkOptions, MintArg
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
```

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK following using your own signer with thirdweb.

### 3. Define which module to use

Now we need to define which module we want to use. This is the module we just created inside our project **Making your own currency**. We called the module **Raza Coin**. This module has an address. We need to pass the address here. You can find the address here, under **Raza Coin**:

In our `currency.py` we include the following code. First we define a variable **currency_smart_contract_address** and store our module address in here.

Then we create an object that uses the token module inside the SDK with our address.

![](./16_module_done.png)

```python title="currency.py"
#pick your module and enter the smart contract address
currency_smart_contract_address = "0xdd25FAEE772FbB1bcB7ba0b2cEE6387A8F82f032"
token_module = sdk.get_currency_module(currency_smart_contract_address)
```

### 4. Time to mint the coins (tokens)!

The arguments passed over here are the same as minting the tokens inside the dashboard. If you want to familiarize yourself with the process, check out the dashboard! Ethereum deals with 18 decimals, so we need to adjust the input figure.

```python title="currency.py"
#Mint tokens on your smart contract

input_amount = 1000
converted_amount = amount* (10**18)
token_module.mint(converted_amount)
```

### 5. Results

Get the balance to check it out or head over to the dashboard.

```python title="currency.py"
#check your balance to check your coins!
print(token_module.balance())
```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash
# Runs the python file
python python_nft.py
```

## That's it!

Congratulations! You have now created your own currency using only Python code! The next step is spending it!
