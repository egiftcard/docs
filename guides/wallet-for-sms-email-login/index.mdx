[magic.link](https://magic.link/) provides wallet for users that login through SMS, Email or Social.

> Magic is a developer SDK that integrates with your application to enable passwordless authentication using magic links (similar to Slack and Medium). Magic enables blazing-fast, hardware-secured, passwordless login with a few lines of code â€” even if you have an existing auth solution.

To learn more about how to set up magic.link in your project, look at:

[Magic for Web](https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/email/integration/web)
