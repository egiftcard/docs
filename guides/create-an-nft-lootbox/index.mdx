# Create NFT Loot-Boxes Using the Pack Contract

In this guide, we'll create a "loot-box" NFT that can be opened to reveal tokens inside of it!

<!-- truncate -->

In more detail, we'll bundle up ERC20, ERC1155, and ERC721 tokens into a set of ERC1155 NFTs using the [Pack](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/pack) contract!

This guide will outline how to:

- Create an ERC20 token
- Create an ERC1155 "semi-fungible" NFT Collection
- Bundle these together to produce a quantity of ERC1155 loot-box NFTs that can be opened to randomly reward the opener with some of the tokens that were bundled into the set!

Demo:

:::tip Source Code

You can access all of the code for this example on our [thirdweb-example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/packs) GitHub org.

If you want to create a copy of this project, run:

```
npx thirdweb create --template packs
```

:::

Let's do this!

### The Idea

We're going to create a pirate-themed loot box!

- The loot-box NFT will be a treasure chest
- Inside the loot boxes, users can unlock two different types of things.

1. Pirate items (swords, keys, flags, etc.) - these will be NFTs.
2. Gold coins - these will be tokens inside our ERC20 token smart contract.

Items will have different rarity levels, so some loot boxes will be better than others!

## Creating the Token

ERC20 is an Ethereum standard for "fungible" tokens, which simply means that each token is the exact same in value as other tokens in this smart contract.

To create the token, I'll use the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

Head to [https://thirdweb.com/contracts/new](https://thirdweb.com/contracts/new/pre-built/token/token).

![Select contract](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688127715/2sUg-4aMM.png)

From here, we'll need to provide:

- `image`
- `name`
- `symbol`
- `description`

for our token!

![Token metadata](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688200341/XnYEirdLO.png)

Once you're happy with your token metadata, click the **Deploy Now** button!

For the purpose of this guide, we'll be deploying our contracts onto the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

If you want to learn more about testnets, check out this guide on [Which network should I use?](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use)

Once we deploy it, we can see the result, which looks like this:

![Current token supply is 0](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688424324/byuBC2loe.png)

Since we have a total supply of `0.0`, let's mint some tokens now, by clicking the **Mint** button!

I'll mint 100 $GOLD tokens:

![Mint gold tokens](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688463894/j9IPiwvu3.png)

Nice! Now we have our very own token, let's start creating some Pirate Item NFTs!

## Creating the ERC1155 NFT Collection

ERC1155 NFTs are known as "semi-fungible" tokens.

They're NFTs, but each NFT in the collection can have multiple "copies". (This is different from the typical ERC721 non-fungible NFT, which can only have one quantity per token.)

Head back to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and click "Deploy New contract". Click "Create NFTs and Tokens", and then **"Edition"**.

Once again, we'll need to provide the metadata for the contract:

![Create Pirate Items](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688834106/QDkSugnTe.png)

Nice! Now we're ready to mint some NFTs into this collection. Here's how it looks so far:

![Pirate items empty state](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655688930210/Z4_fmfexL.png)

Before we dive right into the minting, let's think about how we want our treasure chests to work.

In this collection, I want to have 100 treasure chests total, and each pack contains 5 rewards.

This means we'll need 500 rewards total to be bundled up into the creation of our packs. I have done some planning ahead of time to show how this will work and added different rarity levels of items.

| Name          | Units | Quantity per unit | Total | Chance Per Item (5 items per chest) |
| ------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Compass       | 100   | 1                 | 100   | 20%                                 |
| Anchor        | 100   | 1                 | 100   | 20%                                 |
| Sword         | 100   | 1                 | 100   | 20%                                 |
| Captain's Hat | 65    | 1                 | 65    | 13%                                 |
| Cannon        | 50    | 1                 | 50    | 10%                                 |
| Hook          | 50    | 1                 | 50    | 10%                                 |
| Gold Coins    | 20    | 5                 | 100   | 4%                                  |
| Rum           | 10    | 1                 | 10    | 2%                                  |
| Gold Key      | 5     | 1                 | 5     | 1%                                  |

**Key things to note**

- Gold coins come in quantities of 5, meaning when a user opens this item, they receive `5` gold coins. (For other opened items, they just receive `1`)
- We have different rarity levels based on how many we include to be bundled into the pack. For example, `Gold Key` is the rarest item since there are only 5 of those out of 500 total reward units.

It's important to note that you should do a similar level of planning, as the amount of `pack`s that get created is equal to the:

```text
Amount of total units bundled / Amount of units per pack
```

For example, we've provided 500 units, and have 5 units per pack, so this means we will end up with 100 packs.

Now let's mint these NFTs!

I'll mint the NFTs we listed in the table above with the specified quantity, remembering that our `Gold Coins` are the ERC20 tokens we already created in the previous step!

![Mint an NFT](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655690187754/Tq5wyKSKl.png)

After I've minted all the NFTs, it looks like this:

![All minted NFTs](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655699874962/UNn4XZRaE.png)

Now we're ready to bundle these into our treasure chests - let's make some Packs!

## Creating Packs

We'll move onto a code environment now.

Let's use the CLI to create a new Next.js + TypeScript project:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --next --ts
```

Open this project up in your text editor, and create a new folder called `scripts`.

The first thing we need to do is export our wallet's private key.

:::info How to export your private key

Learn how to [export your private key](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key) from your wallet.

:::

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.

[Learn more about securely accessing your private key](/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key).

:::

```javascript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const NETWORK = "mumbai";
// Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey("<your-private-key-here>", NETWORK);
```

Now, create a file within the `scripts` directory we just created called `deployPack.mjs`.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

(async () => {
  // Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey("<your-private-key-here>", "mumbai");

  const packAddress = await sdk.deployer.deployPack({
    name: "Treasure Chests",
    primary_sale_recipient: "0xb371d1C5629C70ACd726B20a045D197c256E1054",
  });

  console.log(`Pack address: ${packAddress}`);
})();
```

We can run this script by running:

```bash
node ./scripts/deployPack.mjs
```

![Deploy pack with script](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655705189339/3o39tdHD-.png)

Now, our next step is to bundle the NFTs and ERC20 tokens we created into these packs!

Create another file in the `scripts` directory called `bundleTokens.mjs`.

This script will be responsible for minting our Pack NFTs.

There are a few steps to it, so let's break it down step-by-step:

**Import required packages**

```js
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import fs from "fs";
```

**Provide Approval for our Pack contract to transfer our tokens from `Token` and `Edition` contracts.** This is required for the bundling step.

```js
(async () => {
  const packAddress = "0x0Aee160411473f63be2DfF2865E81A1D59636C97";
  const tokenAddress = "0x270d0f9DA22332F33159337E3DE244113a1C863C";
  const editionAddress = "0xb4A48c837aB7D0e5C85eA2b0D9Aa11537340Fa17";

  // Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey("<your-private-key-here>", "mumbai");

  const pack = sdk.getPack(packAddress);

  // Set approval for the pack contract to act upon token and edition contracts
  const token = sdk.getToken(tokenAddress);
  await token.setAllowance(packAddress, 100);

  const edition = sdk.getEdition(editionAddress);
  await edition.setApprovalForAll(packAddress, true);

```

**Upload the Chest Image to IPFS**

```js
// Upload the Chest to IPFS
const ipfsHash = await sdk.storage.upload(chestFile);
const url = ipfsHash.uris[0];
```

**Create the Packs**

```js
 const packNfts = await pack.create({
    // Metadata for the pack NFTs
    packMetadata: {
      name: "Treasure Chest",
      description:
        "A chest containing tools and treasure to help you on your voyages.",
      image: url,
    },

    // Gold coin ERC20 Tokens
    erc20Rewards: [
      {
        contractAddress: tokenAddress,
        quantityPerReward: 5,
        quantity: 100,
        totalRewards: 20,
      },
    ],

    erc1155Rewards: [
      // Compass
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 0,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 100,
      },
      // Anchor
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 1,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 100,
      },
      // Sword
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 2,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 100,
      },
      // Captain's Hat
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 3,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 65,
      },
      // Cannon
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 4,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 50,
      },
      // Hook
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 5,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 50,
      },
      // Rum
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 6,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 10,
      },
      // Gold Key
      {
        contractAddress: editionAddress,
        tokenId: 7,
        quantityPerReward: 1,
        totalRewards: 5,
      },
    ],
    rewardsPerPack: 5,
  });

  console.log(`====== Success: Pack NFTs created =====`);

  console.log(packNfts);
})();

```

Now let's run our script to create the packs!

```bash
node ./scripts/bundleTokens.mjs
```

Voilà!

We now have 100-pack NFTs containing all of the ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens we created in the previous steps!

Now, let's create an interface where users can view their owned packs and open them to see what's inside!

## Creating the UI

Our project comes pre-configured with code to connect and disconnect the user's wallet, we'll be extending this functionality.

First, we'll import `usePack`, `useOwnedNFTs`, and `ThirdwebNftMedia` from the React SDK.

Then, we'll connect to our pack, and use the `useOwnedNFTs` hook to view the packs this currently connected wallet address owns.

```jsx
const pack = usePack("0x0Aee160411473f63be2DfF2865E81A1D59636C97");

const { data: nfts, isLoading } = useOwnedNFTs(pack, address);
```

Now, `data` will contain an array of packs that this wallet address owns.

We then `map` over each of the different ERC1155 tokens they own (assuming you created 1 kind of pack, this should just be `1`):

```jsx
<div className={styles.container}>
  <div className={styles.collectionContainer}>
    {!isLoading ? (
      <div className={styles.nftBoxGrid}>
        {nfts?.map((nft) => (
          <div className={styles.nftBox} key={nft.metadata.id.toString()}>
            <ThirdwebNftMedia
              // @ts-ignore
              metadata={nft.metadata}
              className={styles.nftMedia}
            />
            <h3>{nft.metadata.name}</h3>
            <p>Quantity: {nft.supply?.toNumber()}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    ) : (
      <p>Loading...</p>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
```

With some added [styles](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/packs/tree/main/styles) we have something that looks like this:

![100 treasure chest nfts](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655734747758/UAqWIuD28.png)

Now, we'll need to add the `Open` functionality!

### Opening Packs

To open packs, we simply use the `.open` function and specify how many we want to open.

```tsx
const [openedPackRewards, setOpenedPackRewards] = useState<PackRewards>();

async function open() {
  const openedRewards = await pack?.open(0, 1);
  console.log("Opened rewards:", openedRewards);
  setOpenedPackRewards(openedRewards);
}
```

Here, we're storing the rewards in state, so that we can display them on the UI after a user opens a pack.

Beneath our existing UI, let's create a section to display the opened rewards.

```jsx
            <hr className={styles.divider} />

            <h2>Opened Rewards</h2>

           {openedPackRewards &&
            openedPackRewards?.erc20Rewards &&
            openedPackRewards?.erc20Rewards?.length > 0 && (
              <>
                <h3>ERC20 Tokens</h3>
                <div className={styles.nftBoxGrid}>
                  {openedPackRewards?.erc20Rewards?.map((reward, i) => (
                    <ERC20RewardBox reward={reward} key={i} />
                  ))}
                </div>
              </>
            )}

          {openedPackRewards &&
            openedPackRewards?.erc1155Rewards &&
            openedPackRewards?.erc1155Rewards?.length > 0 && (
              <>
                <h3>ERC1155 Tokens</h3>
                <div className={styles.nftBoxGrid}>
                  {openedPackRewards?.erc1155Rewards.map((reward, i) => (
                    <ERC1155RewardBox reward={reward} key={i} />
                  ))}
                </div>
              </>
            )}
```

You'll notice we've referenced `ERC20RewardBox` and `ERC1155RewardBox` components here. That's because the `rewards` that come back from the `open` function only contain the contract address and token ID.

We'll need to use these values to fetch the metadata about the tokens that we opened. Since that data looks a bit different for the two different types of tokens, that's why I have created two components to simplify it!

Create a folder called `components`, and create two files within it

1. `ERC20RewardBox.tsx`
2. `ERC1155RewardBox.tsx`

**ERC20RewardBox**:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebNftMedia, useMetadata, useToken } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import React from "react";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";

type Props = {
  reward: {
    contractAddress: string,
    quantityPerReward: string | number,
  },
};

export default function ERC20RewardBox({ reward }: Props) {
  const token = useToken(reward.contractAddress);
  const { data } = useMetadata(token);

  return (
    <div className={styles.nftBox}>
      {data && (
        <>
          <ThirdwebNftMedia metadata={data} className={styles.nftMedia} />
          <h3>{data?.name}</h3>
          <p>Amount: {reward.quantityPerReward}</p>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**ERC1155RewardBox**:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebNftMedia, useEdition, useNFT } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { BigNumber } from "ethers";
import React from "react";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";

type Props = {
  reward: {
    tokenId: string | number | bigint | BigNumber,
    contractAddress: string,
    quantityPerReward: string | number | bigint | BigNumber,
  },
};

export default function ERC115RewardBox({ reward }: Props) {
  const edition = useEdition(reward.contractAddress);
  const { data } = useNFT(edition, reward.tokenId);

  return (
    <div className={styles.nftBox}>
      {data && (
        <>
          <ThirdwebNftMedia
            metadata={data?.metadata}
            className={styles.nftMedia}
          />
          <h3>{data?.metadata.name}</h3>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally, we attach the `open` function we created to a button:

```jsx
<button
  className={`${styles.mainButton} ${styles.spacerBottom}`}
  onClick={() => open()}
>
  Open
</button>
```

And we can successfully open packs!

When they are opened, we show the metadata for the tokens that were opened:

![Opened Pack](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655793382843/umg37wLi-.png)

## Conclusion

We've created some awesome NFT packs that reveal NFTs and ERC20 tokens when opened!

In this guide, we have covered:

- Creating a "semi-fungible" NFT Collection
- Minting NFTs with different quantities into our collection
- Creating our own ERC20 token/cryptocurrency
- Bundling all of our NFTs and cryptocurrency supply into packs
- Creating randomized pack openings that reveal the tokens inside!
